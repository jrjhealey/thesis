\chapter{Discussion}\label{Discussion}

Major talking points for discussion:

Size of PVC lumen - effector folding
Mosaicism of paralogs
Population density/disparity of expression
Tail fibre binding candidates/role of diversity etc

Applicability to biotech


Future directions:
	- tail fibre crystallisation
	- further binding studies
	- further in depth study of population heterogeneity/response to different stimuli
	

Remaining PVC mysteries:

Role of ATPase unknown, its conservation may not be totally attributable its role in the PVCs if it performs other cellular roles.
Role of 2 proteins with enzymatic potential (PVC7 and 12) remains unknown
PVC 6 has no good homologies.
Suggest role of lysozyme as split from vgrG? Not sure why its retained
Role of various Lumt proteins not well understood

Also firmly identified Lumt (and Pnf) as unique in various ways. Conversely, Cif operons look to be a mainstay (as well as Unit4?)
