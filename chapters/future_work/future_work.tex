\chapter{Future work}\label{Discussion}

This thesis has covered many different aspects of PVC biology, and also represents a `revival' of a project that had lain idle for a number of years. Consequently, there are many avenues which have generated preliminary data which could be built on significantly in future.

As far as Chapter \ref{structbioinfo} is concerned, the process could be iterated essentially \emph{ad infinitum}, each time benefitting from better homologies through new depositions in the various databanks. In the 3-4 years of this work alone, new homologies to almost every protein have been found. Of course, a key advancement will be the final experimental elucidation of a full PVC structure, hopefully in the not too distant future, as the collaboration with the Max-Planck in Dortmund continues. Once this is done, it would be worthwhile repeating the process for many, if not all PVC proteins, to obtain more accurate homology models for future use. The models obtained in this study will prove useful many aspects of future lab work potentially; providing a reference for the effects of, for instance, mutagenesis, or for the design of anti-peptide antibodies against elements expected to be available on the surface of the complex.

For Chapter \ref{bioinformatics}, it would be interesting to repeat the workflow with a greater number of PVC loci from a greater diversity of genomes. While not reported here, progress has been made on automatically detecting and `isolating' PVC sequences from other genomes, based in part on the criteria defined in this chapter. It would also be advantageous to attempt to fully automate the process of syntenic orthologue clustering and matrix creation for calculation of the Adjusted Wallace Coefficient - at present these tasks are more subjective than is ideal. Hand in hand with this, as ever, it would also be useful to sequence even more genomes for further study.

As the first experimental chapter, Chapter \ref{tailfibres} has opened up a great many future avenues for study. Setting aside the practicalities for a moment, the most obvious tasks are to try and repeat the studies here for as many putative PVC tail fibres as possible. That includes binding partner characterisation (both proteomic and glycan array-based). Some progress along this path is underway, as the ``Pnf" fibre that was cloned in this work, but slightly more recalcitrant to work with, has only recently been subjected to the same affinity experiments as the ``Lumt" fibre. Since then, a further tail fibre from the ``Unit 4" operon of \Pasy{} TT01 has been cloned (as this is the same PVC which is currently under study in Dortmund). Just counting the PVCs which have been studied from the 3 genomes focussed on in this PhD, that leaves approximately another 13 tail fibre proteins which could be cloned and assayed. Much easier said than done, of course, would be further attempts to crystallise and finally resolve the structures of these proteins once and for all, instead of relying on indirect measurements like circular dichroism and SDS-PAGE. Exciting future work will be to recapitulate similar studies of engineering tail fibres, with the intent of altering the specificity of the PVCs, such that they may be able to convey their cargoes to cell/tissue types of our choosing. Current experiments ongoing in the lab are swapping the fibres between different PVC structures, to examine any effects on assembly or binding/function (it's possible for example, that they won't be able to transduce a contraction signal). It is not known for certain that the contraction signal is conveyed through the tail fibres, though this is the case for the T4 phage, so identifying if the fibres are implicated in this function will also be well worth testing in future. If they remain functional with `transplanted' fibres however, this becomes a tool for exploring the role of different PVCs and their natural specificities for different cells.
