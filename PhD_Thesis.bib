Here we present ClonalFrameML, which uses maximum likelihood inference to simultaneously detect recombination in bacterial genomes and account for it in phylogenetic reconstruction. ClonalFrameML can analyse hundreds of genomes in a matter of hours, and we demonstrate its usefulness on simulated and real datasets. We find evidence for recombination hotspots associated with mobile elements in Clostridium difficile ST6 and a previously undescribed 310kb chromosomal replacement in Staphylococcus aureus ST582.

abstract = {Negatively stained specimens of pyocin, a bacteriocin produced by strain R Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined by electron microscopy, and a close resemblance of the pyocin to T-even bacteriophage tails was demonstrated with regard to their fine structure. The main structure of the pyocin was concluded to be a double hollow cylinder, 1200 {\AA} long and 150 {\AA} in outer diameter, which consisted of a “sheath” and a “core”. The sheath appeared capable of contraction. The presence of a “base plate” and “tail fibres” was also suggested. The sheath and the core were found to show markedly different behaviour under various chemical treatments, including those by urea, sodium dodecyl sulphate, acid and alkali. They may be composed of protein subunits which differ from each other in chemical properties. {\textcopyright} 1965, Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial H+-ATPase proteolipid from Neurospora crassa was incorporated into small unilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles and its conformation determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). While the largely alpha-helical conformation is relatively independent of the method of incorporation into vesicles, i.e., rehydration, detergent dialysis, or detergent dilution, the proteolipid conformation was significantly different in detergent micelles and in organic solvents. Only very slight changes in the CD spectrum were observed upon binding of the H+-ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to the proteolipid in vesicles, thus suggesting that the inhibitor acts either by blocking the channel or by masking an essential charge group, rather by than causing an overall conformational change in the channel. Additionally, very similar CD spectra were obtained for vesicles with different lipid/protein mole ratios, indicating either that no substantial conformational differences exist between monomer and multimers or that monomers self-associate to form stable complexes during incorporation into vesicles. This study has provided a physical basis for model-building studies of the proteolipid channel structure.},

abstract = {Summary The type II secretion system (T2SS), a multiprotein machinery spanning two membranes in Gram-negative bacteria, is responsible for the secretion of folded proteins from the periplasm across the outer membrane. The critical multidomain T2SS assembly ATPase GspEEpsE had not been structurally characterized as a hexamer. Here, four hexamers of Vibrio cholerae GspEEpsE are obtained when fused to Hcp1 as an assistant hexamer, as shown with native mass spectrometry. The enzymatic activity of the GspE EpsE-Hcp1 fusions is ∼20 times higher than that of a GspE EpsE monomer, indicating that increasing the local concentration of GspEEpsE by the fusion strategy was successful. Crystal structures of GspEEpsE-Hcp1 fusions with different linker lengths reveal regular and elongated hexamers of GspEEpsE with major differences in domain orientation within subunits, and in subunit assembly. SAXS studies on GspE EpsE-Hcp1 fusions suggest that even further variability in GspE EpsE hexamer architecture is likely. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

An intracellular contractile tubular structure that bears functional homology with bacteriophage tails is pivotal for ejection of pathogenic effectors. Here, we present the 6{\AA} cryoelectron microscopy structure of the contracted Vibrio cholerae tubule consisting of the proteins VipA and VipB. We localized VipA and VipB in the protomer and identified structural homology between the C-terminal segment of VipB and the tail-sheath protein of T4 phages. We propose that homologous segments in VipB and T4 phages mediate tubule contraction. We show that in type VI secretion, contraction leads to exposure of the ClpV recognition motif, which is embedded in the type VI-specific four-helix-bundle N-domain of VipB. Disaggregation of the tubules by the AAA+ protein ClpV and recycling of the VipA/B subunits are thereby limited to the contracted state. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The collagen triple-helix and the $\alpha$-helical coiled coil represent the two basic supercoiled multi-stranded protein motifs. Originally they were characterized in fibrous proteins, but have been found more recently in a number of other proteins containing rod-shaped domains. Coiled-coil domains are responsible for the oligomerization of proteins, as well as other specific functions, while the triplehelix domains associate to form supramolecular structures and bind a variety of ligands. Both structures were originally solved by fiber diffraction, and recent crystallographic studies on small proteins and peptide models have confirmed the structure and provided molecular details. The differences in the molecular conformations of these two motifs and the interactions stabilizing these conformations are discussed. The molecular structures of both motifs constrain the amino acid sequence to recognizable patterns, requiring the (Gly-X-Y)(n) repeating sequence for the collagen triple-helix and a less stringent heptad repeat requirement (h-x-x-h-xx-x)(n) for the coiled-coil domains, where h represents hydrophobic residues. The features and roles of these supercoiled domains in proteins are considered when they are found adjacent in the same protein.},

This enzyme was purified from culture supernatant, and partial amino acid sequence obtained from the purified protein was used to design a degenerate oligonucleotide probe that was used to clone a cross-hybridizing DNA fragment from V. fischeri genomic DNA. Recombinant Escherichia coli clones harboring this fragment possessed ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. The DNA fragment was sequenced, and deletion analysis localized the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity to one of the three possible open reading frames in the fragment; the deduced amino acid sequence from this open reading frame matched the amino acid sequence obtained from the purified protein. V. fischeri ADP-r has no significant homology (DNA or amino acid) with other known ADP-ribosyltransferases. This enzyme appears to require neither proteolytic cleavage nor a reducing agent for enzymatic activity. The cloned gene is expressed but not secreted in E. coli; however, it is secreted from a heterologous marine Vibrio species. We have named this enzyme halovibrin.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions have essential roles at almost every level of organization and communication in living cells. During complex formation, proteins can interact via covalent, surface-surface or peptide-surface contacts. Many protein complexes are now known to involve the binding of linear motifs in one of the binding partners. An emerging mechanism of such non-covalent peptide-surface interaction involves the donation or addition of a $\beta$ strand in the ligand to a $\beta$ sheet or a $\beta$ strand in the receptor. Such '$\beta$-strand addition' contacts can dictate or modulate binding specificity and affinity, or can be used in more promiscuous protein-protein contacts. Three main classes of $\beta$-strand addition can be distinguished: $\beta$-sheet augmentation; $\beta$-strand insertion and fold complementation; and $\beta$-strand zippering. A survey of protein-protein complexes in the protein data bank identifies $\beta$-strand additions in many important metabolic pathways. Targeting these interactions might, thus, provide novel routes for rational drug design. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Larvae of the tubeworm Hydroides elegans, an important biofouling agent, require contact with surface-bound bacteria to undergo metamorphosis; however, the mechanisms that underpin this microbially mediated developmental transition have been enigmatic. Here, we show that a marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea, produces arrays of phage tail-like structures that trigger metamorphosis of H. elegans. These arrays comprise about 100 contractile structures with outward-facing baseplates, linked by tail fibers and a dynamic hexagonal net. Not only do these arrays suggest a novel form of bacterium-animal interaction, they provide an entry point to understanding how marine biofilms can trigger animal development.},

abstract = {Bacteriophage T4 recognises its host cells through its long tail fibre protein gene product (gp) 37. Gp37 is a protein containing 1026 amino acids per monomer, forming a fibrous parallel homotrimer at the distal end of the long tail fibres. The other distal half-fibre protein, gp36, is much smaller, forming a trimer of 221 amino acids per monomer. Functional and structural studies of gp37 have been hampered by the inability to produce suitable amounts of it. We produced soluble gp37 by co-expression with two bacteriophage T4-encoded chaperones in a two-vector system; co-expression with each chaperone separately did not lead to good amounts of correctly folded, trimeric protein. An expression vector for the bacteriophage T4 fibrous protein chaperone gp57 was co-transformed into bacteria with a compatible bi-cistronic expression vector containing bacteriophage T4 genes 37 and 38. A six-histidine tag is encoded amino-terminal to the gp37 gene. Recombinant trimeric gp37, containing the histidine tag and residues 12-1026 of gp37, was purified from lysed bacteria by subsequent nickel-affinity, size exclusion and strong anion exchange column chromatography. Yields of approximately 4 mg of purified protein per litre of bacterial culture were achieved. Electron microscopy confirmed the protein to form fibres around 63 nm long, presumably gp36 makes up the remaining 11 nm in the intact distal half-fibre. Purified, correctly folded, gp37 will be useful for receptor-binding studies, high-resolution structural studies and for specific binding and detection of bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Desmogleins and desmocollins, members of the cadherin superfamily, mediate adhesion at desmosomes. Cytoplasmic components of the desmosome associate with the desmosomal cadherin tails through a series of protein interactions, which serve to recruit intermediate filaments to sites of desmosome assembly. These desmosomal plaque components include plakoglobin and the plakophilins, members of the armadillo gene family. Linkage to the cytoskeleton is mediated by the intermediate filament binding protein, desmoplakin, which associates with both plakoglobin and plakophilins. Although desmosomes are critical for maintaining stable cell-cell adhesion, emerging evidence indicates that they are also dynamic structures that contribute to cellular processes beyond that of cell adhesion. This article outlines the structure and function of the major desmosomal proteins, and explores the contributions of this protein complex to tissue architecture and morphogenesis},

abstract = {Adenoviral (Ad) vectors have been widely used in human gene therapy clinical trials. However, their application has frequently been restricted by the unfavorable expression of cell surface receptors critical for Ad infection. Infections by Ad2 and Ad5 are largely regulated by the elongated fiber protein that mediates its attachment to a cell surface receptor, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR). The fiber protein is a homotrimer consisting of an N-terminal tail, a long shaft, and a C-terminal knob region that is responsible for high-affinity receptor binding and Ad tropism. Consequently, the modification of the knob region, including peptide insertion and C-terminal fusion of ligands for cell surface receptors, has become a major research focus for targeting gene delivery. Such manipulation tends to disrupt fiber assembly since the knob region contains a stabilization element for fiber trimerization. We report here the identification of a novel trimerization element in the Ad fiber shaft. We demonstrate that fiber fragments containing the N-terminal tail and shaft repeats formed stable trimers that assembled onto Ad virions independently of the knob region. This fiber shaft trimerization element (FSTE) exhibited a capacity to support peptide fusion. We showed that Ad, modified with a chimeric protein by direct fusion of the FSTE with a growth factor ligand or a single-chain antibody, delivered a reporter gene selectively. Together, these results indicate that the shaft region of Ad fiber protein contains a trimerization element that allows ligand fusion, which potentially broadens the basis for Ad vector development.},

abstract = {Recombineering allows DNA cloned in Escherichia coli to be modified via lambda (lambda) Red-mediated homologous recombination, obviating the need for restriction enzymes and DNA ligases to modify DNA. Here, we describe the construction of three new recombineering strains (SW102, SW105 and SW106) that allow bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to be modified using galK positive/negative selection. This two-step selection procedure allows DNA to be modified without introducing an unwanted selectable marker at the modification site. All three strains contain an otherwise complete galactose operon, except for a precise deletion of the galK gene, and a defective temperature-sensitive lambda prophage that makes recombineering possible. SW105 and SW106 cells in addition carry l-arabinose-inducible Cre or Flp genes, respectively. The galK function can be selected both for and against. This feature greatly reduces the background seen in other negative-selection schemes, and galK selection is considerably more efficient than other related selection methods published. We also show how galK selection can be used to rapidly introduce point mutations, deletions and loxP sites into BAC DNA and thus facilitate functional studies of SNP and/or disease-causing point mutations, the identification of long-range regulatory elements and the construction of conditional targeting vectors.},

The focus of Phyre2 is to provide biologists with a simple and intuitive interface to state-of-the-art protein bioinformatics tools. Phyre2 replaces Phyre, the original version of the server for which we previously published a paper in Nature Protocols. In this updated protocol, we describe Phyre2, which uses advanced remote homology detection methods to build 3D models, predict ligand binding sites and analyze the effect of amino acid variants (e.g., nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs)) for a user's protein sequence. Users are guided through results by a simple interface at a level of detail they determine. This protocol will guide users from submitting a protein sequence to interpreting the secondary and tertiary structure of their models, their domain composition and model quality. A range of additional available tools is described to find a protein structure in a genome, to submit large number of sequences at once and to automatically run weekly searches for proteins that are difficult to model. The server is available at http://www.sbg. bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2. A typical structure prediction will be returned between 30 min and 2 h after submission},

@article{Hachani2011,
abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium causing chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Such infections are associated with an active type VI secretion system (T6SS), which consists of about 15 conserved components, including the AAA+ ATPase, ClpV. The T6SS secretes two categories of proteins, VgrG and Hcp. Hcp is structurally similar to a phage tail tube component, whereas VgrG proteins show similarity to the puncturing device at the tip of the phage tube. In P. aeruginosa, three T6SSs are known. The expression of H1-T6SS genes is controlled by the RetS sensor. Here, 10 vgrG genes were identified in the PAO1 genome, among which three are co-regulated with H1-T6SS, namely vgrG1a/b/c. Whereas VgrG1a and VgrG1c were secreted in a ClpV1-dependent manner, secretion of VgrG1b was ClpV1-independent. We show that VgrG1a and VgrG1c form multimers, which confirmed the VgrG model predicting trimers similar to the tail spike. We demonstrate that Hcp1 secretion requires either VgrG1a or VgrG1c, which may act independently to puncture the bacterial envelope and give Hcp1 access to the surface. VgrG1b is not required for Hcp1 secretion. Thus, VgrG1b does not require H1-T6SS for secretion nor does H1-T6SS require VgrG1b for its function. Finally, we show that VgrG proteins are required for secretion of a genuine H1-T6SS substrate, Tse3. Our results demonstrate that VgrG proteins are not only secreted components but are essential for secretion of other T6SS substrates. Overall, we emphasize variability in behavior of three P. aeruginosa VgrGs, suggesting that, although very similar, distinct VgrGs achieve specific functions.},

I have studied the tail of bacteriophage lambda, whose length is determined by the length of the 'ruler protein', the product of gene H. The length of the tail can be decreased or increased by deleting the middle part of gene H or by forming a small duplication there, and the length of the tail is proportional to the size of the protein.

abstract = {We have developed a simple and highly efficient method to disrupt chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli in which PCR primers provide the homology to the targeted gene(s). In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells.},

Second, the low level of activated Rho proteins which results from the dual molecular mechanism of action of CNF1 (Rho protein activation followed by their degradation), confers high invasive properties to UPECs. Finally, we have reported that ubiquitylation and degradation of Rac is lost in HEp-2 carcinoma cells, thereby suggesting a possible link between Rho protein ubiquitylation and tumor progression.},

By demonstrating strong RfaH-dependent suppression of transcription polarity in vitro, we have established RfaH as a novel transcriptional activator, and we reveal that RfaH is a homologue of the essential protein NusG that modulates general transcriptional pausing and termination in prokaryotes. Full transcription of the distal genes from an upstream promoter required RfaH and the 5' cls-acting ops element, both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo the requirement for the ops element was suppressed by overexpressing RfaH, and in vitro the presence of ops lowered the concentration of RfaH required to stimulate transcript elongation. We suggest that RfaH directs transcript elongation in an analogous way to NusG, but does so in a subset of bacterial operons primarily engaged in the production of extracellular components required for virulence and fertility.},

Three genomic species were delineated on a consensus assessment. One of these species corresponded to Photorhabdus luminescens, since strains were at least 50{\%} related to the type strain of this species with AT,,, less than 7 "C. The two other species were novel genomic species II and 111, which were less than 40{\%} related to each other with AT, higher than 9 "C. A comparison of the complete 165 rDNA sequences of several representatives of genomic species II and genomic species 111 revealed that each of them formed a stable lineage independent of the cluster generated by P. luminescens strains. The genomic species differed in their maximum temperatures for growth. A correlation with the ecological origin of the bacterial samples was noticed. The heat-tolerant group I (maximum growth temperature 35-39 "C) corresponded to the symbionts of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora groups Brecon and HP88 and Heterorhabditis indica, nematodes living in warm and tropical countries, respectively. Group II (maximum growth temperature 33-35 "C) encompassed symbionts from Heterorhabditis megidis, Heterorhabditis zealandica and group NC1 of H. bacteriophora, nematodes isolated in temperate climates. Group 111 were bacteria isolated from human specimens. Two new species, Photorhabdus temperata sp. nov. (type strain CIP 1055633 and Photorhabdus asymbiotica sp. nov.

However, relatively little is known about the underlying genetic basis for marine bacterial interactions with higher organisms. We examined whole-genome sequences from a large number of marine bacteria for the prevalence of homologues to virulence genes and pathogenicity islands known from bacteria that are pathogenic to terrestrial animals and plants. As many as 60 out of 119 genomes of marine bacteria, with no known association to infectious disease, harboured genes of virulence-associated types III, IV, V and VI protein secretion systems. Type III secretion was relatively uncommon, while type IV was widespread among alphaproteobacteria (particularly among roseobacters) and type VI was primarily found among gammaproteobacteria. Other examples included homologues of the Yersinia murine toxin and a phage-related 'antifeeding' island. Analysis of the Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic data indicated that virulence genes were present in up to 8{\%} of the planktonic bacteria, with highest values in productive waters. From a marine ecology perspective, expression of these widely distributed genes would indicate that some bacteria infect or even consume live cells, that is, generate a previously unrecognized flow of organic matter and nutrients directly from eukaryotes to bacteria.},

Salivary glycoproteins were identified by the hydrazide coupling and release method. In this approach, glycoproteins were coupled onto a hydrazide resin, the proteins were then digested and formerly N-glycosylated peptides were selectively released with the enzyme PNGase F and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Employing this method, coupled with in-solution isoelectric focusing separation as an additional means for pre-fractionation, we identified 84 formerly N-glycosylated peptides from 45 unique N-glycoproteins. Of these, 16 glycoproteins have not been reported previously in saliva. In addition, we identified 44 new sites of N-linked glycosylation on the proteins.},

We have altered the length of a recombinant gene 29 by constructing deletions and duplications in different parts of the gene. Each of these constructs was incorporated into the high-level expression vector, pET-11d. Seven plasmids with different lengths of gene 29 were made and used in complementation studies. We have found that the length of the tail can be decreased by deleting the C-terminal part of gene 29 or increased by forming duplications in different parts of this gene, and that the length of the tail can be proportional to the size of the engineered protein. Unlike phage lambda, plasmids with deletions in the middle of gene 29 or from the N-terminal end produced correspondingly smaller but inactive gene 29 protein and no viable phage were formed. Our results show that alterations in the length of gene 29 protein proportionately alters tail length, and argue strongly for a scheme in which 29 protein is a ruler or template that determines tail length during tail assembly.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli K-12 and B have been the subjects of classical experiments from which much of our understanding of molecular genetics has emerged. We present here complete genome sequences of two E. coli B strains, REL606, used in a long-term evolution experiment, and BL21(DE3), widely used to express recombinant proteins. The two genomes differ in length by 72,304 bp and have 426 single base pair differences, a seemingly large difference for laboratory strains having a common ancestor within the last 67 years. Transpositions by IS1 and IS150 have occurred in both lineages. Integration of the DE3 prophage in BL21(DE3) apparently displaced a defective prophage in the $\lambda$ attachment site of B. As might have been anticipated from the many genetic and biochemical experiments comparing B and K-12 over the years, the B genomes are similar in size and organization to the genome of E. coli K-12 MG1655 and have {\textgreater} 99{\%} sequence identity over ∼ 92{\%} of their genomes. E. coli B and K-12 differ considerably in distribution of IS elements and in location and composition of larger mobile elements. An unexpected difference is the absence of a large cluster of flagella genes in B, due to a 41 kbp IS1-mediated deletion. Gene clusters that specify the LPS core, O antigen, and restriction enzymes differ substantially, presumably because of horizontal transfer. Comparative analysis of 32 independently isolated E. coli and Shigella genomes, both commensals and pathogenic strains, identifies a minimal set of genes in common plus many strain-specific genes that constitute a large E. coli pan-genome. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

The abundance of bacteriocin genes in bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Klebsiella and Photorhabdus suggests that these systems play an important role in the competition between rival bacteria.

abstract = {Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans (Enterobacteriaceae) cause amber disease in the grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an important pasture pest in New Zealand. Larval disease symptoms include cessation of feeding, clearance of the gut, amber coloration, and eventual death. A 155-kb plasmid, pADAP, carries the genes sepA, sepB, and sepC, which are essential for production of amber disease symptoms. Transposon insertions in any of the sep genes in pADAP abolish gut clearance but not cessation of feeding, indicating the presence of an antifeeding gene(s) elsewhere on pADAP. Based on deletion analysis of pADAP and subsequent sequence data, a 47-kb clone was constructed, which when placed in either an Esch-erichia coli or a Serratia background exerted strong antifeeding activity and often led to rapid death of the infected grass grub larvae. Sequence data show that the antifeeding component is part of a large gene cluster that may form a defective prophage and that six potential members of this prophage are present in Photo-rhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1, a species which also has sep gene homologues. Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans (Entero-bacteriaceae) are the causal agents of amber disease of the New Zealand grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scar-abaeidae). The disease was first described by Trought et al. (47), and S. entomophila was subsequently developed into a commercially available biopesticide for C. zealandica in New Zealand (25). The disease is highly host specific, affecting only larvae of a single species of New Zealand scarab. The disease has a distinct progression. Infected larvae cease feeding within 1 to 3 days of ingesting pathogenic cells. The bacteria colonize the digestive tract. The gut, which is normally dark in color, clears (27), and the levels of the major gut protease digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, decrease sharply (28). The clearance of the gut results in a characteristic amber color of the infected hosts. The larvae may remain in this state for a prolonged period (1 to 3 months) before bacteria eventually invade the haemocoel, resulting in rapid death of the larvae (29). Plasmids have been implicated in many human diseases, such as those caused by Yersinia pestis (20) and Salmonella spp. (17). The insecticidal toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis are also often plasmid borne (19). Glare et al. (13) demonstrated that a plasmid, designated pADAP (for amber disease-associated plasmid), was involved in the virulence of S. entomophila against grass grub larvae, as plasmid-cured strains lost virulence. Hurst et al. (23) isolated a 23-kb pADAP BamHI clone (designated pBM32) that in either E. coli or a pADAP-cured strain of S. entomophila conferred both gut clearance and antifeeding ac-tivity. Sequence analysis of this virulence-encoding region showed that the predicted products of three of the open reading frames (ORFs) (sepA, sepB, and sepC) had significant sequence simi-larity to components of the insecticidal toxins produced by the bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens (8) and another nema-tode-associated bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophilus (34). Previous studies showed that mutation of sepA, sepB, or sepC abolished the virulence of the pBM32 clone when expressed in E. coli or pADAP-cured S. entomophila. When these sep-based mutations were recombined into pADAP, the resulting bacte-ria still caused antifeeding but did not cause the gut clearance typical of amber disease (23). This suggests that an additional antifeeding gene(s) may be present elsewhere on pADAP. The occurrence of two different antifeeding genes on pADAP sup-ports dose-response data of Grkovic et al. (15), who found that suppression of feeding was stronger in the wild-type pADK-6 strain than in strains harboring the mutated pADAP deriva-tives pADK-10 (::sepB) or pADK-13 (::sepC). In this report, we describe the identification, cloning, mutagenesis, and nucleotide sequence analysis of the pADAP antifeeding-encoding region.},

abstract = {We report an easy procedure for isolating chromosome-clustered genes. By following this methodology, the entire set of genes belonging to the phenylacetic acid (PhAc; 18-kb) pathway as well as those required for the synthesis and mobilization of different polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs; 6.4 kb) in Pseudomonas putida U were recovered directly from the bacterial chromosome and cloned into a plasmid for the first time. The transfor-mation of different bacteria with these genetic constructions conferred on them the ability to either degrade PhAc or synthesize bioplastics (PHAs). The cloning and functional analyses of large gene clusters usually entail significant difficulties. Cloning procedures are often limited by the absence of the required restriction sites on the DNA fragment to be cloned, and the expression of the encoded proteins is always affected by mutations introduced in the sequence when large DNA regions are to be amplified (2, 3, 9, 17, 22, 30). These problems are further exacerbated when little information about the sequence, organization, and regu-lation of the genes to be cloned is available. Thus, in order to facilitate the cloning of all of the genes and regulatory ele-ments included in large genetic assemblages, we have devel-oped a different strategy. Using a simple method based on a single recombination event (27), we have been able to (i) recover the selected genes from the genome, obtaining a faith-ful copy of the desired genetic construction; (ii) clone them into a plasmid; and (iii) transfer their complete biosynthetic or catabolic routes to other microbes, enhancing the metabolic capabilities of these microbes. Our approach, which is of un-doubted scientific interest, is also very useful from a practical point of view, since it facilitates the cloning of linked sets of genes that might be required to reproduce basic processes of biochemical or genetic interest as well as others of biotechno-logical or industrial importance. Accordingly, we describe here the methodological bases of the procedure and illustrate its practical use by describing the isolation and expression of the entire phenylacetic acid (PhAc) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) pathways, which are of great scientific interest (6, 13, 20) and have important biotechnolog-ical applications (11, 12).},

J. {\&} Beckwith, J. (1995) J. Bacteriol. 177, 4121-4130] showed that expression of a cloned gene could be modulated over several orders of magnitude in cultures grown in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of arabinose. We constructed plasmids expressing a fast-folding mutant Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein from the araBAD promoter to examine the distribution of expressed gene products in individual cells at intermediate induction levels. Microscopic examination of cells grown at low arabinose concentrations shows mixtures of brightly fluorescent and dark cells, suggesting that intermediate expression levels in cultures reflect a population average of induced and uninduced cells. The kinetics of green fluorescent protein induction suggest that this reflects an "autocatalytic" induction mechanism due to accumulation of the inducer by active transport. This mechanism, which is analogous to the induction of the lac operon at subsaturating inducer concentrations in lacY+ cells, was described 40 years ago by Novick and Weiner [Novick, A. {\&} Weiner, M.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Hu and Artsimovitch. RfaH activates horizontally acquired operons that encode lipopolysaccharide core components, pili, toxins, and capsules. Unlike its paralog NusG, which potentiates Rho-mediated silencing, RfaH strongly inhibits Rho. RfaH is recruited to its target operons via a network of contacts with an elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) and a specific DNA element called ops to modify RNAP into a pause- and NusG-resistant state. rfaH null mutations confer hypersensitivity to antibiotics and detergents, altered susceptibility to bacteriophages, and defects in virulence. Here, we carried out a selection for suppressors that restore the ability of a $\Delta$rfaH mutant Escherichia coli strain to grow in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. We isolated rho, rpoC, and hns suppressor mutants with changes in regions previously shown to be important for their function. In addition, we identified mutants with changes in an unstructured region that connects the primary RNA-binding and helicase domains of Rho. The connector mutants display strong defects in vivo, consistent with their ability to compensate for the loss of RfaH, and act synergistically with bicyclomycin (BCM), which has been recently shown to inhibit Rho transformation into a translocation-competent state. We hypothesize that the flexible connector permits the reorientation of Rho domains and serves as a target for factors that control the motor function of Rho allosterically. Our results, together with the existing data, support a model in which the connector segment plays a hitherto overlooked role in the regulation of Rho-dependent termination. IMPORTANCE The transcription termination factor Rho silences foreign DNA, reduces antisense transcription, mediates surveillance of mRNA quality, and maintains genome integrity by resolving transcription-replication collisions and deleterious R loops. Upon binding to RNA, Rho undergoes a rate-limiting transition from an open “lock washer” state to a closed ring capable of processive translocation on, and eventually the release of, the nascent transcript. Recent studies revealed that Rho ligands, including its cofactor NusG and inhibitor bicyclomycin, control the ring dynamics allosterically. In this work, we used a genetic selection for suppressors of RfaH, a potent inhibitor of Rho, to isolate a new class of mutations in a flexible region that connects the primary RNA-binding and ATPase/translocase domains of Rho. We propose that the connector is essential for the modulation of Rho activity by different RNA sequences and accessory proteins.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces three types of bacteriocins: R-, F- and S-type pyocins. The S-type pyocin is a colicin-like protein, whereas the R-type pyocin resembles a contractile but non-flexible tail structure of bacteriophage, and the F-type a flexible but non-contractile one. As genetically related phages exist for each type, these pyocins have been thought to be variations of defective phage. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of R2 pyocin genes, along with those for F2 pyocin, which are located downstream of the R2 gene cluster on the chromosome of P. aeruginosa PAO1, was analysed in order to elucidate the relationship between the pyocins and bacteriophages. The results clearly demonstrated that the R-type pyocin is derived from a common ancestral origin with P2 phage and the F-type from lambda phage. This notion was supported by identification of a lysis gene cassette similar to those for bacteriophages. The gene organization of the R2 and F2 pyocin gene cluster, however, suggested that both pyocins are not simple defective phages, but are phage tails that have been evolutionarily specialized as bacteriocins. A systematic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of P. aeruginosa strains that produce various subtypes of R and F pyocins revealed that the genes for every subtype are located between trpE and trpG in the same or very similar gene organization as for R2 and F2 pyocins, but with alterations in genes that determine the receptor specificity.},

abstract = {Recently, a highly efficient recombination system for chromosome engineering in Escherichia coli was described that uses a defective $\lambda$ prophage to supply functions that protect and recombine a linear DNA targeting cassette with its substrate sequence (Yu et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97, 5978–5983). Importantly, the recombination is proficient with DNA homologies as short as 30–50 bp, making it possible to use PCR-amplified fragments as the targeting cassette. Here, we adapt this prophage system for use in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) engineering by transferring it to DH10B cells, a BAC host strain. In addition, arabinose inducible cre and flpe genes are introduced into these cells to facilitate BAC modification using loxP and FRT sites. Next, we demonstrate the utility of this recombination system by using it to target cre to the 3′ end of the mouse neuron-specific enolase (Eno2) gene carried on a 250-kb BAC, which made it possible to generate BAC transgenic mice that specifically express Cre in all mature neurons. In addition, we show that fragments as large as 80 kb can be subcloned from BACs by gap repair using this recombination system, obviating the need for restriction enzymes or DNA ligases. Finally, we show that BACs can be modified with this recombination system in the absence of drug selection. The ability to modify or subclone large fragments of genomic DNA with precision should facilitate many kinds of genomic experiments that were difficult or impossible to perform previously and aid in studies of gene function in the postgenomic era.},

abstract = {A novel folding motif has been observed in four different proteins which bind oligonucleotides or oligosaccharides: staphylococcal nuclease, anticodon binding domain of asp-tRNA synthetase and B-subunits of heat-labile enterotoxin and verotoxin-1. The common fold of the four proteins, which we call the OB-fold, has a five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel. This barrel is capped by an alpha-helix located between the third and fourth strands. The barrel-helix frameworks can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 1.4-2.2 A, but no similarities can be observed in the corresponding alignment of the four sequences. The nucleotide or sugar binding sites, known for three of the four proteins, are located in nearly the same position in each protein: on the side surface of the beta-barrel, where three loops come together. Here we describe the determinants of the OB-fold, based on an analysis of all four structures. These proposed determinants explain how very different sequences adopt the OB-fold. They also suggest a reinterpretation of the controversial structure of gene 5 ssDNA binding protein, which exhibits some topological and functional similarities with the OB-fold proteins.},

abstract = {The iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) server is an integrated platform for automated protein structure and function prediction based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm. Starting from an amino acid sequence, I-TASSER first generates three-dimensional (3D) atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations. The function of the protein is then inferred by structurally matching the 3D models with other known proteins. The output from a typical server run contains full-length secondary and tertiary structure predictions, and functional annotations on ligand-binding sites, Enzyme Commission numbers and Gene Ontology terms. An estimate of accuracy of the predictions is provided based on the confidence score of the modeling. This protocol provides new insights and guidelines for designing of online server systems for the state-of-the-art protein structure and function predictions.

abstract = {The success of tailed bacteriophages to infect cells far exceeds that of most other viruses on account of their specialized tail and associated baseplate structures. The baseplate protein gene product (gp) 10 of bacteriophage T4, whose structure was determined to 1.2 {\AA} resolution, was fitted into the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the pre and post-infection conformations of the virus. gp10 functions as a molecular lever that rotates and extends the hinged short tail fibers to facilitate cell attachment. The central folding motif of the gp10 trimer is similar to that of the baseplate protein gp11 and to the receptor-binding domain of the short tail fiber, gp12. The three proteins comprise the periphery of the baseplate and interact with each other. The structural and functional similarities of gp10, gp11, and gp12 and their sequential order in the T4 genome suggest that they evolved separately, subsequent to gene triplication from a common ancestor. Such events are usual in the evolution of complex organelles from a common primordial molecule. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Previous attempts to express the toxin complex genes of Photorhabdus luminescens W14 in Escherichia coli have failed to reconstitute their oral toxicity to the model insect Manduca sexta. Here we show that the combination of three genes, tcdA, tcdB, and tccC, is essential for oral toxicity to M. sexta when expression in E. coli is used. Further, when transcription from native toxin complex gene promoters is used, maximal toxicity in E. coli cultures is associated with the addition of mitomycin C to the growth medium. In contrast, the expression of tcdAB (or the homologous tcaABC operon) with no recombinant tccC homolog in a different P. luminescens strain, K122, is sufficient to confer oral toxicity on this strain, which is otherwise not orally toxic. We therefore infer that P. luminescens K122 carries a functional tccC-like homolog within its own genome, a hypothesis supported by Southern analysis. Recombinant toxins from both P. luminescens K122 and E. coli were purified as high-molecular-weight particulate preparations. Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images of these particulate preparations showed that the expression of tcdAB (either with or without tccC) in E. coli produces visible approximately 25-nm-long complexes with a head and tail-like substructure. These data are consistent with a model whereby TcdAB constitutes the majority of the complex visible under TEM and TccC either is a toxin itself or is an activator of the complex. The implications for the potential mode of action of the toxin complex genes are discussed.},

abstract = {Ring-forming AAA(+) ATPases act in a plethora of cellular processes by remodeling macromolecules. The specificity of individual AAA(+) proteins is achieved by direct or adaptor-mediated association with substrates via distinct recognition domains. We investigated the molecular basis of substrate interaction for Vibrio cholerae ClpV, which disassembles tubular VipA/VipB complexes, an essential step of type VI protein secretion and bacterial virulence. We identified the ClpV recognition site within VipB, showed that productive ClpV-VipB interaction requires the oligomeric state of both proteins, solved the crystal structure of a ClpV N-domain-VipB peptide complex, and verified the interaction surface by mutant analysis. Our results show that the substrate is bound to a hydrophobic groove, which is formed by the addition of a single $\alpha$-helix to the core N-domain. This helix is absent from homologous N-domains, explaining the unique substrate specificity of ClpV. A limited interaction surface between both proteins accounts for the dramatic increase in binding affinity upon ATP-driven ClpV hexamerization and VipA/VipB tubule assembly by coupling multiple weak interactions. This principle ensures ClpV selectivity toward the VipA/VipB macromolecular complex.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli hlyCABD operons encode the polypeptide component (Hly A) of an extracellular cytolytic toxin, as well as proteins required for its acylation (HlyC) and sec-independent secretion (HlyBD). Previous reports suggested that the E. coli protein RfaH is required for wild-type hemolysin expression, either by positively activating hly transcript initiation (M. J. A. Bailey, V. Koronakis, T. Schmoll, and C. Hughes, Mol. Microbiol. 6:1003-1012, 1992) or by promoting proper insertion of hemolysin export machinery in the E. coli outer membrane (C. Wandersman and S. Letoffe, Mol. Microbiol. 7:141-150, 1993). RfaH is also required for wild-type levels of mRNA transcribed from promoter-distal genes in the rfaQ-K, traY-Z, and rplK-rpoC gene clusters, suggesting that RfaH is a transcriptional antiterminator. We tested these models by analyzing the effects of rfaH mutations on hlyCABD mRNA synthesis and decay, HlyA protein levels, and hemolytic activity. The model system included a uropathogenic strain of E. coli harboring hlyCABD on the chromosome and E. coli K-12 transformed with the hlyCABD operon on a recombinant plasmid. Our results suggest that RfaH enhances hlyCABD transcript elongation, consistent with the model of RfaH involvement in transcriptional antitermination in E. coli. We also demonstrated that RfaH increases toxin efficacy. Modulation of hemolysin activity may be an indirect effect of RfaH-dependent E. coli outer membrane chemotype, which is consistent with the model of lipopolysaccharide involvement in hemolytic activity.},

abstract = {The computational reconstruction of ancestral proteins provides information on past biological events and has practical implications for biomedicine and biotechnology. Currently available tools for ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) are often based on empirical amino acid substitution models that assume that all sites evolve at the same rate and under the same process. However, this assumption is frequently violated because protein evolution is highly heterogeneous due to different selective constraints among sites. Here, we present ProtASR, a new evolutionary framework to infer ancestral protein sequences accounting for selection on protein stability. First, ProtASR generates site-specific substitution matrices through the structurally constrained mean-field substitution model (MF), which considers both unfolding and misfolding stability. We previously showed that MF models outperform empirical amino acid substitution models, as well as other structurally constrained substitution models, both in terms of likelihood and correctly inferring amino acid distributions across sites. In the second step, ProtASR adapts a well-established maximum-likelihood (ML) ASR procedure to infer ancestral proteins under MF models. A known bias of ML ASR methods is that they tend to overestimate the stability of ancestral proteins by under-estimating the frequency of deleterious mutations. We compared ProtASR under MF to two empirical substitution models (JTT and CAT), reconstructing the ancestral sequences of simulated proteins. ProtASR yields reconstructed proteins with less biased stabilities, which are significantly closer to those of the simulated proteins. Analysis of extant protein families suggests that folding stability evolves through time across protein families, potentially reflecting neutral fluctuation. Some families exhibit a more constant protein folding stability, while others are more variable. ProtASR is freely available from https://github.com/miguelarenas/protasr and includes detailed documentation and ready-to-use examples. It runs in seconds/minutes depending on protein length and alignment size.},

abstract = {Photorhabdus is a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae that lives in a mutualistic association with a Heterorhabditis nematode worm. The nematode worm burrows into insect prey and regurgitates Photorhabdus, which goes on to kill the insect. The nematode feeds off the growing bacteria until the insect tissues are exhausted, whereupon they reassociate and leave the cadaver in search of new prey. This highly efficient partnership has been used for many years as a biological crop protection agent. The dual nature of Photorhabdus as a pathogen and mutualist makes it a superb model for understanding these apparently exclusive activities. Furthermore, recently identified clinical isolates of Photorhabdus are helping us to understand how human pathogens can emerge from the enormous reservoir of invertebrate pathogens in the environment. As Photorhabdus has never been found outside a host animal, its niche represents an entirely biotic landscape. In this review we discuss what molecular adaptations allow this bacterium to complete this fascinating and complex life cycle.},

The E. coli contaminants display high affinity to divalent nickel or cobalt ions, mainly due to the presence of clustered histidine residues or biologically relevant metal binding sites. To improve the final purity of expressed His-tagged protein, we engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) expression strains in which the most recurring contaminants are either expressed with an alternative tag or mutated to decrease their affinity to divalent cations. The current study presents the design, engineering, and characterization of two E. coli BL21(DE3) derivatives, NiCo21(DE3) and NiCo22(DE3), which express the endogenous proteins SlyD, Can, ArnA, and (optionally) AceE fused at their C terminus to a chitin binding domain (CBD) and the protein GlmS, with six surface histidines replaced by alanines. We show that each E. coli CBD-tagged protein remains active and can be efficiently eliminated from an IMAC elution fraction using a chitin column flowthrough step, while the modification of GlmS results in loss of affinity for nickel-containing resin.

The bacterium has a complex life cycle with a symbiotic stage in which bacteria colonize the intestinal tract of the nematodes, and a pathogenic stage against susceptible larval-stage insect. Symbiosis-"deficient" phenotypic variants (known as secondary forms) arise during prolonged incubation. Correspondence analysis of the in silico proteome translated from the genome sequence of strain TT01 identified two major biases in the amino acid composition of the proteins. We analyzed the proteome, separating three classes of extracts: cellular, extracellular, and membrane-associated proteins, resolved by 2-DE. Approximately 450 spots matching the translation products of 231 different coding DNA sequences were identified by PMF. A comparative analysis was performed to characterize the protein content of both variants. Differences were evident during stationary growth phase. Very few proteins were found in variant II supernatants, and numerous proteins were lacking in the membrane-associated fraction. Proteins up-regulated by the phenotypic variation phenomenon were involved in oxidative stress, energy metabolism, and translation. The transport and binding of iron, sugars and amino acids were also affected and molecular chaperones were strongly down-regulated. A potential role for H-NS in phenotypic variation control is discussed.},

These molecular machines comprise at least 13 proteins. Although recent years have witnessed advances in the role and function of these secretion systems, little is known about how these complexes assemble in the cell envelope. Interestingly, the current information converges to the idea that T6SSs are composed of two subassemblies, one resembling the contractile bacteriophage tail, whereas the other subunits are embedded in the inner and outer membranes and anchor the bacteriophage-like structure to the cell envelope. In this review, we summarize recent structural information on individual T6SS components emphasizing the fact that T6SSs are composite systems, adapting subunits from various origins.},

Rapid progress is being made in elucidating the structural components of the T6SS apparatus, and a few effectors have been reported to pass through it. However, this is not the complete story: a family of T6SS proteins, the VgrGs, share structural features with the cell-puncturing device of the T4 bacteriophage, and may be used in a similar fashion by bacteria to puncture host cell membranes and insert the T6SS apparatus into the host cytosol. Interestingly, a number of VgrGs contain C-terminal extensions with effector-domains. Thus, the T6SS may translocate soluble effectors, as well as VgrG effector-domains. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Some strains of Serratia entomophila and S. proteamaculans cause amber disease of the New Zealand grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an important pasture pest in New Zealand. The disease determinants of S. entomophila, are encoded on a 153,404-bp plasmid, termed pADAP for amber disease associated plasmid. The S. proteamaculans strain 143 (Sp143) exhibits an unusual pathotype, where only 60-70{\%} of C. zealandica larvae infected with the bacterium succumb to disease. DNA sequence analysis of the Sp143 pU143 virulence associated region identified high DNA similarity to the pADAP sep virulence associated region, with DNA sequence variation in the sepA gene and the variable region of the sepC component. No pADAP anti-feeding prophage orthologue was detected in the Sp143 genome. The region of pADAP replication was cloned and found to replicate in S. entomophila but not in Escherichia coli. DNA sequence analysis of the plasmid pSG348 repA gene from the French isolate of Serratia grimesii, identified 93{\%} DNA identity to the pADAP repA gene. A comparison of the pU143 virulence associated region with the completed pADAP nucleotide sequence is given. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

An essential and expanding subset of these assemblies comprises proteins of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) family. The defining feature of AAA+ proteins is a structurally conserved ATP-binding module that oligomerizes into active arrays. ATP binding and hydrolysis events at the interface of neighboring subunits drive conformational changes within the AAA+ assembly that direct translocation or remodeling of target substrates. In this review, we describe the critical features of the AAA+ domain, summarize our current knowledge of how this versatile element is incorporated into larger assemblies, and discuss specific adaptations of the AAA+ fold that allow complex molecular manipulations to be carried out for a highly diverse set of macromolecular targets.},

Genes (afp1-18) encoding components of Afp were expressed and their products purified allowing morphological assessment of the products by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Expression of afp1-15 resulted in the formation of a non-sheathed structure termed the tube-baseplate complex or TBC, composed of an irregular-length tube attached to a baseplate with associated tail fibres. Expression of afp1-16 produced mature, normal-length Afp particles, whereas coexpression of afp16 with afp1-15 in trans resulted in the formation of aberrant Afp particles of variable lengths. A C-terminally truncated Afp16 mutant resulted in a phenotype intermediate between mature Afp and TBC. The addition of purified Afp16 to Afp unravelled by acidic treatment resulted in the formation of shorter tubes when specimen pH was adjusted to 7 than those formed in the absence of Afp16. Analysis of TEM images of purified Afp16 revealed a hexameric ring-like structure similar to that formed by gp3 of phage T4 and gpU of phage $\lambda$.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions. RESULTS An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff {\textgreater} -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 A for RMSD. CONCLUSION The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER.},

abstract = {Amino acid repeats (AARs) are abundant in protein sequences. They have particular roles in protein function and evolution. Simple repeat patterns generated by DNA slippage tend to introduce length variations and point mutations in repeat regions. Loss of normal and gain of abnormal function owing to their variable length are potential risks leading to diseases. Repeats with complex patterns mostly refer to the functional domain repeats, such as the well-known leucine-rich repeat and WD repeat, which are frequently involved in protein-protein interaction. They are mainly derived from internal gene duplication events and stabilized by 'gate-keeper' residues, which play crucial roles in preventing inter-domain aggregation. AARs are widely distributed in different proteomes across a variety of taxonomic ranges, and especially abundant in eukaryotic proteins. However, their specific evolutionary and functional scenarios are still poorly understood. Identifying AARs in protein sequences is the first step for the further investigation of their biological function and evolutionary mechanism. In principle, this is an NP-hard problem, as most of the repeat fragments are shaped by a series of sophisticated evolutionary events and become latent periodical patterns. It is not possible to define a uniform criterion for detecting and verifying various repeat patterns. Instead, different algorithms based on different strategies have been developed to cope with different repeat patterns. In this review, we attempt to describe the amino acid repeat-detection algorithms currently available and compare their strategies based on an in-depth analysis of the biological significance of protein repeats.},

abstract = {HvnA and HvnB are proteins secreted by Vibrio fischeri ES114, an extracellular light organ symbiont of the squid Euprymna scolopes, that catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD(+) to polyarginine. Based on this activity, HvnA and HvnB were presumptively designated mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTases), and it was hypothesized that they mediate bacterium-host signaling. We have cloned hvnA and hvnB from strain ES114. hvnA appears to be expressed as part of a four-gene operon, whereas hvnB is monocistronic. The predicted HvnA and HvnB amino acid sequences are 46{\%} identical to one another and share 44{\%} and 34{\%} identity, respectively, with an open reading frame present in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome. Four lines of evidence indicate that HvnA and HvnB mediate polyarginine ADP-ribosylation not by ARTase activity, but indirectly through an NAD(+)-glycohydrolase (NADase) activity that releases free, reactive, ADP-ribose: (i) like other NADases, and in contrast to the ARTase cholera toxin, HvnA and HvnB catalyzed ribosylation of not only polyarginine but also polylysine and polyhistidine, and ribosylation was inhibited by hydroxylamine; (ii) HvnA and HvnB cleaved 1, N(6)-etheno-NAD(+) and NAD(+); (iii) incubation of HvnA and HvnB with [(32)P]NAD(+) resulted in the production of ADP-ribose; and (iv) purified HvnA displayed an NADase V(max) of 400 mol min(-1) mol(-1), which is within the range reported for other NADases and 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold higher than the minor NADase activity reported in bacterial ARTase toxins. Construction and analysis of an hvnA hvnB mutant revealed no other NADase activity in culture supernatants of V. fischeri, and this mutant initiated the light organ symbiosis and triggered regression of the light organ ciliated epithelium in a manner similar to that for the wild type.},

abstract = {Ring-forming AAA(+) ATPases act in a plethora of cellular processes by remodeling macromolecules. The specificity of individual AAA(+) proteins is achieved by direct or adaptor-mediated association with substrates via distinct recognition domains. We investigated the molecular basis of substrate interaction for Vibrio cholerae ClpV, which disassembles tubular VipA/VipB complexes, an essential step of type VI protein secretion and bacterial virulence. We identified the ClpV recognition site within VipB, showed that productive ClpV-VipB interaction requires the oligomeric state of both proteins, solved the crystal structure of a ClpV N-domain-VipB peptide complex, and verified the interaction surface by mutant analysis. Our results show that the substrate is bound to a hydrophobic groove, which is formed by the addition of a single $\alpha$-helix to the core N-domain. This helix is absent from homologous N-domains, explaining the unique substrate specificity of ClpV. A limited interaction surface between both proteins accounts for the dramatic increase in binding affinity upon ATP-driven ClpV hexamerization and VipA/VipB tubule assembly by coupling multiple weak interactions. This principle ensures ClpV selectivity toward the VipA/VipB macromolecular complex.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem. Effects of recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication, gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among closely related organisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe a new method to align two or more genomes that have undergone rearrangements due to recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and loss (flux). We demonstrate that the new method can accurately align regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an important case not handled by our previous work. The method uses a novel alignment objective score called a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score, which facilitates accurate detection of rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have unequal gene content. We also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering method to remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which are commonly observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and indel predictions. The new genome alignment algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in situations where genomes have undergone biologically feasible amounts of genome rearrangement, segmental gain and loss. We apply the new algorithm to a set of 23 genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella. Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows us to extend the previously defined concepts of core- and pan-genomes to include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions with potential regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a pan-genome of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level variability among these organisms driven by segmental gain and loss.

abstract = {Photorhabdus are highly effective insect pathogenic bacteria that exist in a mutualistic relationship with Heterorhabditid nematodes. Unlike other members of the genus, Photorhabdus asymbiotica can also infect humans. Most Photorhabdus cannot replicate above 34°C, limiting their host-range to poikilothermic invertebrates. In contrast, P. asymbiotica must necessarily be able to replicate at 37°C or above. Many well-studied mammalian pathogens use the elevated temperature of their host as a signal to regulate the necessary changes in gene expression required for infection. Here we use RNA-seq, proteomics and phenotype microarrays to examine temperature dependent differences in transcription, translation and phenotype of P. asymbiotica at 28°C versus 37°C, relevant to the insect or human hosts respectively. Our findings reveal relatively few temperature dependant differences in gene expression. There is however a striking difference in metabolism at 37°C, with a significant reduction in the range of carbon and nitrogen sources that otherwise support respiration at 28°C. We propose that the key adaptation that enables P. asymbiotica to infect humans is to aggressively acquire amino acids, peptides and other nutrients from the human host, employing a so called "nutritional virulence" strategy. This would simultaneously cripple the host immune response while providing nutrients sufficient for reproduction. This might explain the severity of ulcerated lesions observed in clinical cases of Photorhabdosis. Furthermore, while P. asymbiotica can invade mammalian cells they must also resist immediate killing by humoral immunity components in serum. We observed an increase in the production of the insect Phenol-oxidase inhibitor Rhabduscin normally deployed to inhibit the melanisation immune cascade. Crucially we demonstrated this molecule also facilitates protection against killing by the alternative human complement pathway.},

abstract = {Protein secretion systems are vital for prokaryotic life, as they enable bacteria to acquire nutrients, communicate with other species, defend against biological and chemical agents, and facilitate disease through the delivery of virulence factors. In this review, we will focus on the recently discovered type IX secretion system (T9SS), a complex translocon found only in some species of theBacteroidetesphylum. T9SS plays two roles, depending on the lifestyle of the bacteria. It provides either a means of movement (called gliding motility) for peace-loving environmental bacteria or a weapon for pathogens. The best-studied members of these two groups areFlavobacterium johnsoniae, a commensal microorganism often found in water and soil, andPorphyromonas gingivalis, a human oral pathogen that is a major causative agent of periodontitis. InP. gingivalisand some other periodontopathogens, T9SS translocates proteins, especially virulence factors, across the outer membrane (OM). Proteins destined for secretion bear a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that directs the cargo to the OM translocon. At least 18 proteins are involved in this still enigmatic process, with some engaged in the post-translational modification of T9SS cargo proteins. Upon translocation across the OM, the CTD is removed by a protease with sortase-like activity and an anionic LPS is attached to the newly formed C-terminus. As a result, a cargo protein could be secreted into the extracellular milieu or covalently attached to the bacterial surface. T9SS is regulated by a two-component system; however, the precise environmental signal that triggers it has not been identified. Exploring unknown systems contributing to bacterial virulence is exciting, as it may eventually lead to new therapeutic strategies. During the past decade, the major components of T9SS were identified, as well as hints suggesting the possible mechanism of action. In addition, the list of characterized cargo proteins is constantly growing. The actual structure of the translocon, situated in the OM of bacteria, remains the least explored area; however, new technical approaches and increasing scientific attention have resulted in a growing body of data. Therefore, we present a compact up-to-date review of this topic.},

abstract = {Twenty strains (including eight phase variant pairs) of nematode-symbiotic and insect-pathogenic Photorhabdus bacteria were examined for the production of proteolytic enzymes by using a combination of several methods, including gelatin liquefaction, zymography coupled to native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and activity measurement with two chromogen substrate types. Four protease activities (approximately 74, approximately 55, approximately 54, and approximately 37 kDa) could be separated. The N-terminal sequences of three of the proteases were determined, and a comparison with sequences in databases allowed identification of these proteases as HEXXH metallopeptidases. Thus, the 74-kDa protease (described formerly as Php-B [J. Marokhazi, G. Koczan, F. Hudecz, L. Graf, A. Fodor, and I. Venekei, Biochem. J. 379:633-640, 2004) is an ortholog of OpdA, a member the thimet oligopeptidase family, and the 55-kDa protease is an ortholog of PrtA, a HEXXH+H peptidase in clan MB (metzincins), while the 37-kDa protease (Php-C) belongs to the HEXXH+E peptidases in clan MA. The 54-kDa protease (Php-D) is a nonmetalloenzyme. PrtA and Php-C were zymographically detected, and they occurred in several smaller forms as well. OpdA could not be detected by zymography. PrtA, Php-C, and Php-D were secreted proteases; OpdA, in contrast, was an intracellular enzyme. OpdA activity was found in every strain tested, while Php-D was detected only in the Brecon/1 strain. There was significant strain variation in the secretion of PrtA and Php-C activities, but reduced activity or a lack of activity was not specific to secondary-phase variants. The presence of PrtA, OpdA, and Php-C activities could be detected in the hemolymph of Galleria melonella larvae 20 to 40 h postinfection. These proteases appear not to be directly involved in the pathogenicity of Photorhabdus, since strains or phase variants lacking any of these proteases do not show reduced virulence when they are injected into G. melonella larvae.},

abstract = {Peptidoglycan is the major structural constituent of the bacterial cell wall, forming a meshwork outside the cytoplasmic membrane that maintains cell shape and prevents lysis. In Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan is located in the periplasm, where it is protected from exogenous lytic enzymes by the outer membrane. Here we show that the type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches this barrier to deliver two effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, to the periplasm of recipient cells. In this compartment, the effectors hydrolyse peptidoglycan, thereby providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa cells in competition with other bacteria. To protect itself from lysis by Tse1 and Tse3, P. aeruginosa uses specific periplasmically localized immunity proteins. The requirement for these immunity proteins depends on intercellular self-intoxication through an active type VI secretion system, indicating a mechanism for export whereby effectors do not access donor cell periplasm in transit.},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format.

abstract = {Allergens were identified from the gastrointestinal nematode of sheep, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, by probing Western blots of infective larvae (third stage) somatic antigen with IgE purified from the serum of sheep grazed on worm contaminated pasture. A 31 kDa allergen was frequently recognised by sera from immune sheep, particularly those deriving from a line that has been genetically selected over 23 years for parasite resistance. Using a proteomic approach, the 31 kDa allergen was identified as an aspartyl protease inhibitor homologue. The entire coding sequence of T. colubriformis aspartyl protease inhibitor (Tco-api-1) was obtained and the mature protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Anti-Tco-API-1 antibodies revealed that a commonly observed 21 kDa T. colubriformis allergen species is a truncated form of Tco-API-1. Specific IgE responses to T. colubriformis aspartyl protease inhibitor were significantly correlated with the degree of resistance to nematode infection as measured by faecal egg count in sheep. Surprisingly, IgE responses to Tco-API-1 were not correlated with breech soiling (dag score), which is thought to be caused, in part, by allergic hypersensitivity to worms. Therefore, a specific IgE response to this allergen may be a suitable marker for identifying lambs at an early age that will develop strong immunity to gastrointestinal nematodes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) type III secretion system (T3SS) is a key pathogenicity factor in Erwinia amylovora. Previous studies have demonstrated that the T3SS in E. amylovora is transcriptionally regulated by a sigma factor cascade. In this study, the role of the bacterial alarmone ppGpp in activating the T3SS and virulence of E. amylovora was investigated using ppGpp mutants generated by Red recombinase cloning. The virulence of a ppGpp-deficient mutant (ppGpp(0)) as well as a dksA mutant of E. amylovora was completely impaired, and bacterial growth was significantly reduced, suggesting that ppGpp is required for full virulence of E. amylovora. Expression of T3SS genes was greatly downregulated in the ppGpp(0) and dksA mutants. Western blotting showed that accumulations of the HrpA protein in the ppGpp(0) and dksA mutants were about 10 and 4{\%}, respectively, of that in the wild-type strain. Furthermore, higher levels of ppGpp resulted in a reduced cell size of E. amylovora. Moreover, serine hydroxamate and $\alpha$-methylglucoside, which induce amino acid and carbon starvation, respectively, activated hrpA and hrpL promoter activities in hrp-inducing minimal medium. These results demonstrated that ppGpp and DksA play central roles in E. amylovora virulence and indicated that E. amylovora utilizes ppGpp as an internal messenger to sense environmental/nutritional stimuli for regulation of the T3SS and virulence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPORTANCE: The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a key pathogenicity factor in Gram-negative bacteria. Fully elucidating how the T3SS is activated is crucial for comprehensively understanding the function of the T3SS, bacterial pathogenesis, and survival under stress conditions. In this study, we present the first evidence that the bacterial alarmone ppGpp-mediated stringent response activates the T3SS through a sigma factor cascade, indicating that ppGpp acts as an internal messenger to sense environmental/nutritional stimuli for the regulation of the T3SS and virulence in plant-pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the recovery of an spoT null mutant, which displayed very unique phenotypes, suggested that small proteins containing a single ppGpp hydrolase domain are functional.},

A class of such proteins is used by viruses as adhesins, and recent studies revealed novel beta-structured motifs for them. We have been studying the folding and assembly of adenovirus fibers that consist of a globular C-terminal domain, a central fibrous shaft, and an N-terminal part that attaches to the viral capsid. The globular C-terminal, or "head" domain, has been postulated to be necessary for the trimerization of the fiber and might act as a registration signal that directs its correct folding and assembly. In this work, we replaced the head of the fiber by the trimerization domain of the bacteriophage T4 fibritin, termed "foldon." Two chimeric proteins, comprising the foldon domain connected at the C-terminal end of four fiber shaft repeats with or without the use of a natural linker sequence, fold into highly stable, SDS-resistant trimers. The structural signatures of the chimeric proteins as seen by CD and infrared spectroscopy are reported. The results suggest that the foldon domain can successfully replace the fiber head domain in ensuring correct trimerization of the shaft sequences. Biological implications and implications for engineering highly stable, beta-structured nanorods are discussed.},

abstract = {AAA ATPases form a large protein family with manifold cellular roles. They belong to the AAA+ superfamily of ringshaped P-loop NTPases, which exert their activity through the energy-dependent unfolding of macromolecules. Phylogenetic analyses have suggested the existence of five major clades of AAA domains (proteasome subunits, metalloproteases, domains D1 and D2 of ATPases with two AAA domains, and the MSP1/katanin/spastin group), as well as a number of deeply branching minor clades. These analyses however have been characterized by a lack of consistency in defining the boundaries of the AAA family. We have used cluster analysis to delineate unambiguously the group of AAA sequences within the AAA+ superfamily. Phylogenetic and cluster analysis of this sequence set revealed the existence of a sixth major AAA clade, comprising the mitochondrial, membrane-bound protein BCS1 and its homologues. In addition, we identified several deep branches consisting mainly of hypothetical proteins resulting from genomic projects. Analysis of the AAA N-domains provided direct support for the obtained phylogeny for most branches, but revealed some deep splits that had not been apparent from phylogenetic analysis and some unexpected similarities between distant clades. It also revealed highly degenerate D1 domains in plant MSP1 sequences and in at least one deeply branching group of hypothetical proteins (YC46), showing that AAA proteins with two ATPase domains arose at least three times independently. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Current structural models of the T6SS indicate that the apparatus is composed of at least two complexes, a dynamic bacteriophage-like structure and a cell-envelope-spanning membrane-associated assembly. How these complexes interact to promote effector secretion and cell targeting remains a major question in the field. As a contact-dependent pathway with specific cellular targets, the T6SS is subject to tight regulation. Thus, the identification of regulatory elements that control T6S expression continues to shape our understanding of the environmental circumstances relevant to its function.

Rapid progress is being made in elucidating the structural components of the T6SS apparatus, and a few effectors have been reported to pass through it. However, this is not the complete story: a family of T6SS proteins, the VgrGs, share structural features with the cell-puncturing device of the T4 bacteriophage, and may be used in a similar fashion by bacteria to puncture host cell membranes and insert the T6SS apparatus into the host cytosol. Interestingly, a number of VgrGs contain C-terminal extensions with effector-domains. Thus, the T6SS may translocate soluble effectors, as well as VgrG effector-domains. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Genes encoding type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are widely distributed in pathogenic Gram-negative bacterial species. In Vibrio cholerae, T6SS have been found to secrete three related proteins extracellularly, VgrG-1, VgrG-2, and VgrG-3. VgrG-1 can covalently cross-link actin in vitro, and this activity was used to demonstrate that V. cholerae can translocate VgrG-1 into macrophages by a T6SS-dependent mechanism. Protein structure search algorithms predict that VgrG-related proteins likely assemble into a trimeric complex that is analogous to that formed by the two trimeric proteins gp27 and gp5 that make up the baseplate "tail spike" of Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4. VgrG-1 was shown to interact with itself, VgrG-2, and VgrG-3, suggesting that such a complex does form. Because the phage tail spike protein complex acts as a membrane-penetrating structure as well as a conduit for the passage of DNA into phage-infected cells, we propose that the VgrG components of the T6SS apparatus may assemble a "cell-puncturing device" analogous to phage tail spikes to deliver effector protein domains through membranes of target host cells.},

abstract = {The final step in the morphogenesis of long-tailed double-stranded DNA bacteriophages is the joining of the DNA-filled head to the tail. The connector is a specialized structure of the head that serves as the interface for tail attachment and the point of egress for DNA from the head during infection. Here, we report the determination of a 2.1???? crystal structure of gp6 of bacteriophage HK97. Through structural comparisons, functional studies, and bioinformatic analysis, gp6 has been determined to be a component of the connector of phage HK97 that is evolutionarily related to gp15, a well-characterized connector component of bacteriophage SPP1. Whereas the structure of gp15 was solved in a monomeric form, gp6 crystallized as an oligomeric ring with the dimensions expected for a connector protein. Although this ring is composed of 13 subunits, which does not match the symmetry of the connector within the phage, sequence conservation and modeling of this structure into the cryo-electron microscopy density of the SPP1 connector indicate that this oligomeric structure represents the arrangement of gp6 subunits within the mature phage particle. Through sequence searches and genomic position analysis, we determined that gp6 is a member of a large family of connector proteins that are present in long-tailed phages. We have also identified gp7 of HK97 as a homologue of gp16 of phage SPP1, which is the second component of the connector of this phage. These proteins are members of another large protein family involved in connector assembly. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These reactions include the use of physical barriers together with local and systemic immune responses. First, epithelia, such as those beneath the cuticle, in the alimentary tract, and in tracheae, act both as a physical barrier and local defense against pathogens by producing antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species. Second, specialized hemocytes participate in phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign intruders in the hemolymph. Finally, the fat body, a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver, produces humoral response molecules including antimicrobial peptides.

abstract = {We have made a curious observation that the proteolytic enzyme, trypsin, induced a rapid and complete release of the contents of vesicles composed of dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and oleic acid (OA). Content release at 37°C, monitored by the release of an entrapped fluorescence marker (calcein), was accompanied by an extensive vesicle aggregation. The lytic activity of trypsin on the vesicles depended on pH and liposome composition. The optimal pH for vesicle lysis was below pH 7.4, which was different from the optimal pH for catalytic activity of trypsin. The lytic activity of trypsin was specific for vesicles composed of DOPE and fatty acids such as OA and palmitoleic acid; vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, N-methyl-DOPE, and OA, or DOPE combined with other negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid were not sensitive to trypsin. Inhibition of enzyme activity by trypsin inhibitors did not abolish the lytic activity, suggesting that the lytic activity of trypsin is not related to the catalytic activity. However, the lytic activity of trypsin on vesicles composed of DOPE and OA was inhibited in the presence of excess vesicles containing negative charges, or by a pretreatment of trypsin with acylating reagent to reduce the positive-charge content of trypsin. These data demonstrate that vesicle aggregation and lysis are the results of electrostatic interactions of positive charges on trypsin and negative charges on the vesicles. Phase separation and transition to nonbilayer phases of the vesicle lipids are likely involved. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are present in about a quarter of all Gram-negative bacteria. Several key components of T6SS are evolutionarily related to components of contractile nanomachines such as phages and R-type pyocins. The T6SS assembly is initiated by formation of a membrane complex that binds a phage-like baseplate with a sharp spike, and this is followed by polymerization of a long rigid inner tube and an outer contractile sheath. Effectors are preloaded onto the spike or into the tube during the assembly by various mechanisms. Contraction of the sheath releases an unprecedented amount of energy, which is used to thrust the spike and tube with the associated effectors out of the effector cell and across membranes of both bacterial and eukaryotic target cells. Subunits of the contracted sheath are recycled by T6SS-specific unfoldase to allow for a new round of assembly. Live-cell imaging has shown that the assembly is highly dynamic and its subcellular localization is in certain bacteria regulated with a remarkable precision. Through the action of effectors, T6SS has mainly been shown to contribute to pathogenicity and competition between bacteria. This review summarizes the knowledge that has contributed to our current understanding of T6SS mode of action.},

Empirical analyses of CD data rely on the availability of reference datasets comprised of far-UV CD spectra of proteins whose crystal structures have been determined. This paper reports on the creation of a new reference dataset which eﬀectively covers both secondary structure and fold space, and uses the higher information content available in synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectra to more accurately predict secondary structure than has been possible with existing reference datasets. It also examines the eﬀects of wavelength range, structural redundancy, and diﬀerent means of categorizing secondary structures on the accuracy of the analyses. In addition it describes a novel use of hierarchical cluster analyses to identify protein relatedness based on spectral properties alone. The databases are shown to be applicable in both conventional CD and SRCD spectroscopic analyses of proteins. Hence, by combining new bioinformatics and biophysical methods, a database has been produced that should have wide applicability as a tool for structural molecular biology.},

In contrast to the widely distributed Sec and Twin Arginine Translocation (TAT) systems, the recently identified ESX/type VII systems show a more restricted distribution and are typical for mycobacteria and other high-GC Actinobacteria. Similarly, type VII-like secretion systems have been described in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. While the most complex organization of type VII secretion systems currently known is found in slow-growing mycobacteria, which harbour up to 5 chromosomal-encoded systems (ESX-1 to ESX-5), much simpler organization is reported for type VII-like systems in Firmicutes. In this chapter, we describe common and divergent features of type VII- and type VII-like secretion pathways and also comment on their biological key roles, many of which are related to species-/genus-specific host--pathogen interactions and/or virulence mechanisms.},

abstract = {The baseplate of bacteriophage T4 is a multiprotein molecular machine that controls host cell recognition, attachment, tail sheath contraction and viral DNA ejection. We report here the three-dimensional structure of the baseplate-tail tube complex determined to a resolution of 12 A by cryoelectron microscopy. The baseplate has a six-fold symmetric, dome-like structure approximately 520 A in diameter and approximately 270 A long, assembled around a central hub. A 940 A-long and 96 A-diameter tail tube, coaxial with the hub, is connected to the top of the baseplate. At the center of the dome is a needle-like structure that was previously identified as a cell puncturing device. We have identified the locations of six proteins with known atomic structures, and established the position and shape of several other baseplate proteins. The baseplate structure suggests a mechanism of baseplate triggering and structural transition during the initial stages of T4 infection.},

abstract = {: Monocins in Listeria were induced by UV-irradiation of liquid cultures, and defective phage particles were purified from the lysates. Electron microscopy showed flexible, non-contractile bacteriophage-tail-like particles, consisting of specific proteins of molecular mass 20-45 kDa and pl 4.6-6.7. These particles were able to lyse listerial cells. DNA sequence homologies between chromosomal DNA of monocin-producing strains and labelled Listeria phage DNAs were inferred from DNA/DNA hybridizations, suggesting that most of the prophage DNA is still present in the listerial chromosome. An endolysin gene cpl2438 was cloned from listerial chromosomal DNA and was identified by its expression of lytic activity against Listeria cells in a bioassay. The gene consists of 864 nt encoding a protein of 287 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 32975 Da (CPL2438). This is in good agreement with the size of a protein observed in SDS-PAGE after overexpression of the lytic protein in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a putative holin gene (hol2438, 291 nt) upstream of cpl2438 was determined after PCR-amplification of listerial DNA and it shows typical features common to the holin gene family. Expression of the encoded protein (HOL2438, 95 aa, 10.1 kDa) in E. coli was found to be lethal for the host cells. The results underline the close relationship between monocins and intact Listeria bacteriophages, indicating that monocins are incompletely assembled phage particles derived from cryptic prophages of Listeria, probably including the phage lysin.},

abstract = {Examination of 55 clinical isolates of uropathogenic Escherichia coli producing the CNF1 toxin demonstrated that the cnf1 gene is systematically associated with a hly operon via a highly conserved hlyD-cnf1 intergenic region (igs, 943 bp) as shown in the J96 UPEC strain. We examined if this association could reflect a co-regulation of the production of these toxins. Translation of cnf1 from an immediately upstream promoter has been shown to be controlled by means of an anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence present in the cnf1 coding sequence [fold-back inhibition (cnf1 fbi)]. The cnf1 fbi was not regulated by elements present in the igs. An RNA covering the full hlyD sequence, the igs and extending on the cnf1 gene, was then detected in the J96 strain. This RNA could be part of a HlyCABD mRNA. Transcription of the haemolysin operon requires RfaH antitermination activity. Inactivation of rfaH in J96 resulted in a 100-fold reduction of the CNF1 content of bacteria. The production of CNF1 from a plasmidic igscnf1 DNA was not sensitive to RfaH, indicating that this factor acted on cnf1 transcription via the hly promoter. This way the cnf1 fbi mechanism might be overcome by transcription of cnf1 from the haemolysin promoter and antitermination by RfaH. This constitutes a novel system of bacterial virulence factors co-regulation.},

abstract = {The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile molecular weapon used by many bacteria against eukaryotic hosts or prokaryotic competitors. It consists of a cytoplasmic bacteriophage tail-like structure anchored in the bacterial cell envelope via a cytoplasmic baseplate and a periplasmic membrane complex. Rapid contraction of the sheath in the bacteriophage tail-like structure propels an inner tube/spike complex through the target cell envelope to deliver effectors. While structures of purified contracted sheath and purified membrane complex have been solved, because sheaths contract upon cell lysis and purification, no structure is available for the extended sheath. Structural information about the baseplate is also lacking. Here, we use electron cryotomography to directly visualize intact T6SS structures inside Myxococcus xanthus cells. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we resolve the structure of the extended sheath and membrane-associated components including the baseplate. Moreover, we identify novel extracellular bacteriophage tail fiber-like antennae. These results provide new structural insights into how the extended sheath prevents premature disassembly and how this sophisticated machine may recognize targets.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa, like many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, requires its type III secretion system (T3SS) to facilitate acute infections. In P. aeruginosa, the expression of all T3SS-related genes is regulated by the transcriptional activator ExsA. A signaling cascade involving ExsA and three additional proteins, ExsC, ExsD, and ExsE, directly ties the upregulation of ExsA-mediated transcription to the activation of the type III secretion apparatus. In order to characterize the events underlying the signaling process, the crystal structure of the T3SS chaperone ExsC in complex with its cognate effector ExsE has been determined. The structure reveals critical contacts that mediate the interactions between these two proteins. Particularly striking is the presence of two Arg-X-Val-X-Arg motifs in ExsE that form identical interactions along opposite sides of an ExsC dimer. The structure also provides insights into the interactions of ExsC with the antiactivator protein ExsD. It was shown that the amino-terminal 46 residues of ExsD are sufficient for ExsC binding. On the basis of these findings, a new model for the ExsC.ExsD complex is proposed to explain its distinctive 2:2 stoichiometry and why ExsC displays a weaker affinity for ExsD than for ExsE.},

This "escape synthesis" can result from transcription that initiates at a phage promoter and extends into the gal operon. The effect requires the product of the lambda gene N. N-mediated transcription not only fails to terminate at the prophage-bacterial junction and at the ends of bacterial operons, but ignores termination signals caused by polar insertions or ochre mutations within gal. Suppression of polarity by N-function is a cis-effect; only transcription initiated at the phage promoter is influenced. We propose that the transcription complex is influenced by N-product to become termination-resistant at a site in the phage genome (juggernaut model). This site appears to be at or near the phage promoter.},

abstract = {Ants were the most apparent invertebrate scavengers observed foraging on entomopathogenic nematode-killed insects (i.e., insect cadavers containing entomopathogenic nematodes and their symbiotic bacteria) in the present study. Workers of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), scavenged nemato-dekilled insects on the surface and those buried 2 cm below the soil surface. Ant workers scavenged significantly more steinernematid-killed (60-85{\%}) than heterorhabditid-killed (10-20{\%}) insects. More 4-day-postinfected cadavers (hosts died within 48 h after exposure to nematodes) were scavenged than 10-day-postinfected cadavers. Ten-day-postinfected hosts contained live infective juvenile nematodes therefore ants may serve as phoretic agents. Other ant species, including Veromessor andrei (Mayr), Pheidole vistana Forel, Formica pacifica Francoeur, and Monomoriom ergatogyna Wheeler, also scavenged nematode-killed insects. These ant species removed or destroyed about 45{\%} of the steinernematid-killed insects. These results suggest that survival of steinernematid nematodes may be more significantly impacted by invertebrate scavengers, especially ants, than that of heterorhabditid nematodes, and placement of steinernematid-killed insects in the field for biological control may be an ineffective release strategy. Because entomopathogenic nematodes kill insects with the help of symbiotic bacteria, we tested the role of these bacterial species in deterring invertebrate scavengers by injecting bacteria (without nematodes) into insects and placing the cadavers in the field. None of the insects killed by the symbiotic bacterium, Photorhabdus luminescens (Thomas and Poinar) from Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar, were scavanged, whereas 70{\%} of the insects killed by the symbiotic bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophilus (Poinar and Thomas) from Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser), and 90{\%} of the insects killed by Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner were scavenged by the Argentine ant. We conclude that P. luminescens is responsible for preventing ants from foraging on heterorhabditid-killed hosts.},

Consequently, alternative mechanisms for entry of coxsackievirus and adenovirus into cells have been suggested. We have found that tear fluid promotes adenovirus infection, and we have identified human lactoferrin (HLf) as the tear fluid component responsible for this effect. HLf alone was found to promote binding of adenovirus to epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner and also infection of epithelial cells by adenovirus. HLf was also found to promote gene delivery from an adenovirus-based vector. The mechanism takes place at the binding stage and functions independently of CAR. Thus, we have identified a novel binding mechanism whereby adenovirus hijacks HLf, a component of the innate immune system, and uses it as a bridge for attachment to host cells.},

In gram-negative bacteria, these proteins must cross the cytoplasmic or inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane to reach the cell surface. Gram-negative bacteria have evolved multiple pathways to allow protein secretion across their complex envelope. ATP is not available in the periplasm and many of these secretion pathways encode components that harness energy available at the inner membrane to drive secretion across the outer membrane. In contrast, the autotransporter, two-partner secretion and chaperone/usher pathways are comparatively simple systems that allow secretion across the outer membrane without the need for input of energy from the inner membrane. This review will present overviews of these 'self-sufficient' pathways, focusing on recent advances and secretion mechanisms. Similarities among the pathways and with other protein translocation mechanisms will be highlighted.},

Regulatory patterns of HSI-I suggested that the apparatus functions during chronic infections. We detected Hcp1 in pulmonary secretions of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and Hcp1-specific antibodies in their sera. Thus, HSI-I likely contributes to the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa in CF patients.

Its solution provides biologists with computational tools to organize the rapidly growing set of thousands of known protein shapes, to identify new types of protein architecture, and to discover unexpected evolutionary relations, reaching back billions of years, between protein molecules. Protein shape comparison also improves tools for identifying gene functions in genome databases by defining the essential sequence-structure features of a protein family. Finally, an exhaustive all-on-all shape comparison provides a map of physical attractor regions in the abstract shape space of proteins, with implications for the processes of protein folding and evolution.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The sequence alignment/map (SAM) and the binary alignment/map (BAM) formats have become the standard method of representation of nucleotide sequence alignments for next-generation sequencing data. SAM/BAM files usually contain information from tens to hundreds of millions of reads. Often, the sequencing technology, protocol and/or the selected mapping algorithm introduce some unwanted biases in these data. The systematic detection of such biases is a non-trivial task that is crucial to drive appropriate downstream analyses. RESULTS: We have developed Qualimap, a Java application that supports user-friendly quality control of mapping data, by considering sequence features and their genomic properties. Qualimap takes sequence alignment data and provides graphical and statistical analyses for the evaluation of data. Such quality-control data are vital for highlighting problems in the sequencing and/or mapping processes, which must be addressed prior to further analyses.

abstract = {The RfaH protein controls the transcription of a specialized group of Escherichia coli and Salmonella operons that direct the synthesis, assembly and export of the lipopolysaccharide core, exopolysaccharide, F conjugation pilus and haemolysin toxin. RfaH is a specific regulator of transcript elongation; its loss increases transcription polarity in these operons without affecting initiation from the operon promoters. The operons of the RfaH-dependent regulon contain a short conserved 5' sequence, the ops element, deletion of which increases operon polarity to an extent similar to that caused by loss of RfaH. The ops element is also present upstream of polysaccharide gene clusters of Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the RP4 fertility operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that this is a widely spread control system. The mechanistic coupling of RfaH and the ops element has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and we suggest that the ops element recruits RfaH and potentially other factors to the RNA polymerase complex, modifying the complex to increase its processivity and allowing transcription to proceed over long distances.},

abstract = {Photorhabdus is an entomopathogenic bacterium symbiotically associated with nematodes of the family Heterorhabditidae. Bacterial hemolysins found in numerous pathogenic bacteria are often virulence factors. We describe here the nucleotide sequence and the molecular characterization of the Photorhabdus luminescens phlBA operon, a locus encoding a hemolysin which shows similarities to the Serratia type of hemolysins. It belongs to the two-partner secretion (TPS) family of proteins. In low-iron conditions, a transcriptional induction of the phlBA operon was observed by using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, causing an increase in PhlA hemolytic activity compared to iron-rich media. A spontaneous phase variant of P. luminescens was deregulated in phlBA transcription. The phlA mutant constructed by allelic exchange remained highly pathogenic after injection in the lepidopteran Spodoptera littoralis, indicating that PhlA hemolysin is not a major virulence determinant. Using the gene encoding green fluorescent protein as a reporter, phlBA transcription was observed in hemolymph before insect death. We therefore discuss the possible role of PhlA hemolytic activity in the bacterium-nematode-insect interactions. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Photorhabdus (6) are associated with the entomopathogenic nematodes of the family Heterorhabditidae. These bacteria, which are highly pathogenic to insects, are transported by their nematode hosts into the hemocoel of the insect prey, which is killed probably via a combination of toxin action and septice-mia. The bacterial symbionts contribute to the symbiotic rela-tionship by establishing and maintaining suitable conditions for nematode reproduction. During the final stages of develop-ment, the bacteria and the nematode reassociate and subse-quently leave the insect carcass in search of a new insect host (26). Recently, isolations of some nonsymbiotic Photorhabdus strains from infected humans in Australia and the United States were reported (21, 40). The wild-type bacterium that is normally isolated from sym-biotic infective-stage nematodes is referred to as phase I. Like many pathogenic bacteria, Photorhabdus strains spontaneously produce colonial variants in vitro which have been called phase II variants (5, 26). Both variants of the bacteria have generally been shown to be equally pathogenic for the larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (26). The bacterial factors involved in killing the insect or in overcoming the insect's immune reactions are still under in-vestigation. After invasion of the insect host by the nematodes, bacteria produce potential virulence factors, including lipase, protease, and lipopolysaccharides in the hemocoel (for a re-view, see reference 26). It was shown that purified lipopolysac-charide or Photorhabdus protease fractions had no toxic effect after injection into insect hemocoel (7, 13). Recently, a novel toxin complex (Tc) with oral toxicity to a wide range of insects was identified in a supernatant of Photorhabdus luminescens W14 (8). Purified toxin complex a (Tca) has specific effects on the midgut epithelium of the insect (4). It has recently been shown that Tca, Tcd, and an RTX-like metalloprotease are expressed in vivo during insect infection (17). Hemolysins are extracellular toxic proteins produced by many gram-negative (e.g., Escherichia coli, Vibrio spp.) and gram-positive (e.g., Streptococcus spp., Listeria spp.) bacteria and are known to function as virulence factors. Most of them are active against a wide range of nucleated cell types and thus are also called cytolysins. Bacterial hemolysins are usually rec-ognized on blood agar plates where a transparent zone appears around colonies. Hemolysis production in some Photorhabdus strains was first described by Farmer et al. (21). These bacteria have been shown to display an unusual reaction on sheep blood agar plate, designated annular hemolysis (1); this reaction was considered to be a marker in the identification of Photorhabdus asymbiotica isolated from clinical specimens (21, 25). Recently, we described the production of zones of hemolysis on sheep blood agar around several strains of Photorhabdus and Xeno-rhabdus, another symbiotic bacterium of nematodes (11). We also identified the presence of a cytolysin active on insect hemocytes and on sheep erythrocytes in Xenorhabdus culture supernatants, whereas such activity could not be detected in Photorhabdus supernatants. In Photorhabdus spp., other fac-tors might be responsible for the hemolysis observed on blood agar medium. Therefore, we investigated hemolysin produc-tion by Photorhabdus.

abstract = {The recently identified type VI secretion systems (T6SS) have a crucial function in the virulence of various proteobacteria, including the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. T6SS are encoded by a conserved gene cluster comprising approximately 15 open reading frames, mediating the appearance of Hcp and VgrG proteins in cell culture supernatants. Here, we analysed the function of the V. cholerae T6SS member ClpV, a specialized AAA+ protein. ClpV is crucial for a functional T6SS and interacts through its N-terminal domain with the VipA/VipB complex that is composed of two conserved and essential members of T6SS. Transferring ClpV substrate specificity to a distinct AAA+ protein involved in proteolysis caused degradation of VipA but not Hcp or VgrG2, suggesting that VipA rather than Hcp/VgrG2 functions as a primary ClpV substrate. Strikingly, VipA/VipB form tubular, cogwheel-like structures that are converted by a threading activity of ClpV into small complexes. ClpV-mediated remodelling of VipA/VipB tubules represents a crucial step in T6S, illuminating an unexpected role of an ATPase component in protein secretion.},

abstract = {The association of a molecular chaperone, gp57A, of bacteriophage T4, which facilitates formation of the long and short tail fibers, was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation, differential scanning microcalorimetry, and stopped-flow circular dichroism (CD) to establish the association scheme of the protein. Gp57A is an oligomeric $\alpha$-helix protein with 79 amino acids. Analysis of the sedimentation velocity data by direct boundary modeling with Lamm equation solutions together with a more detailed boundary analysis incorporating association schemes led us to conclude that at least three oligomeric species of gp57A are in reversible and fast association equilibria and that a 3mer-6mer-12mer model described the data best. On the other hand, differential scanning microcalorimetry revealed a highly reversible two-step transition of dissociation/denaturation, both of which accompanied decrease in CD at 222 nm. The melting curve analysis revealed that it is consistent with a 6mer-3mer-1mer model. The refolding/association kinetics of gp57A measured by stopped-flow CD was consistent with the interpretation that the bimolecular reaction from trimer to hexamer was preceded by a fast $\alpha$-helix formation in the dead-time. Trimer or hexamer is likely the functional oligomeric state of gp57A.},

Given the biological and computational complexity of this task, the automatic generation of high-quality alignments remains challenging. Since multiple alignments are usually employed at the very start of data analysis pipelines, it is crucial to ensure high alignment quality. We describe a simple, yet elegant, solution to assess the biological accuracy of alignments automatically. Our approach is based on the comparison of several alignments of the same sequences. We introduce two functions to compare alignments: the average overlap score and the multiple overlap score. The former identifies difficult alignment cases by expressing the similarity among several alignments, while the latter estimates the biological correctness of individual alignments. We implemented both functions in the MUMSA program and demonstrate the overall robustness and accuracy of both functions on three large benchmark sets.},

The HSI-I virulence locus encodes for several proteins that has been proposed to participate in protein transport including the Hcp1 protein, which forms hexameric rings that assemble into nanotubes in vitro. Two Hcp1 paralogues have been identified in the P. aeruginosa genome, Hsp2 and Hcp3. Here, we present the structure of the Hcp3 protein from P. aeruginosa. The overall structure of the monomer resembles Hcp1 despite the lack of amino-acid sequence similarity between the two proteins. The monomers assemble into hexamers similar to Hcp1. However, instead of forming nanotubes in head-to-tail mode like Hcp1, Hcp3 stacks its rings in head-to-head mode forming double-ring structures.},

abstract = {Type VII secretion (T7S) systems of mycobacteria secrete substrates over the unusual diderm cell envelope. Furthermore, T7S gene clusters are present throughout the phylum Actinobacteria, and functional T7S-like systems have been identified in Firmicutes. Most of the T7S substrates can be divided into two families: the Esx proteins, which are found in both Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and the PE and PPE proteins, which are more mycobacterium-specific. Members of both families have been shown to be secreted as folded heterodimers, suggesting that this is a conserved feature of T7S substrates. Most knowledge of the mechanism of T7S and the roles of T7S systems in virulence comes from studies of pathogenic mycobacteria. These bacteria can contain up to five T7S systems, called ESX-1 to ESX-5, each having its own role in bacterial physiology and virulence.In this article, we discuss the general composition of T7S systems and the role of the individual components in secretion. These conserved components include two membrane proteins with (predicted) enzymatic activities: a predicted ATPase (EccC), likely to be required for energy provision of T7S, and a subtilisin-like protease (MycP) involved in processing of specific substrates. Additionally, we describe the role of a conserved intracellular chaperone in T7S substrate recognition, based on recently published crystal structures and molecular analysis. Finally, we discuss system-specific features of the different T7S systems in mycobacteria and their role in pathogenesis and provide an overview of the role of T7S in virulence of other pathogenic bacteria.},

abstract = {Plate (or slope) cultures of endomycin-producing Streptomyces endus (KCC S-0213) showed spontaneously developing pocks which increased in number during subculturing. Neither spore formation nor typical aerial hyphae formation was observed in the pocks, whereas formation of substrate hyphase was not inhibited. Almost all of the hyphae were broken or lysed in the pocks, and many phage tail tiplike particles were observed in the pocks. No self-replication activity was associated with the particles. The particles often formed a hexagonal crystal or a large crystal mass. The production of these particles did not occur in the liquid culture or in young or normal plate cultures having no pocks. These results were similar to those obtained from the plaque-making phenomenon, except for active phage production, in thiostrepton-producing Streptomyces azureus (ATCC 14921), which has been described previously.},

Homologous recombination mediated by Red$\alpha$$\beta$ from lambda phage has been widely used for recombinant DNA engineering. Here we present a protocol for direct cloning and engineering of biosynthetic gene clusters, large operons or single genes from genomic DNA using one Escherichia coli host that harbors both RecET and Red$\alpha$$\beta$ systems. The pipeline uses standardized cassettes for horizontal gene transfer options, as well as vectors with different replication origins configured to minimize recombineering background through the use of selectively replicating templates or CcdB counterselection. These optimized reagents and protocols facilitate fast acquisition of transgenes from genomic DNA preparations, which are ready for heterologous expression within 1 week.},

abstract = {The role of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs) in pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium infection in the chicken is poorly studied, while many studies have been completed in murine models. The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is a recently described protein secretion system in Gram-negative bacteria. The genus Salmonella contains five phylogenetically distinct T6SS encoded in differentially distributed genomic islands. S. Typhimurium harbors a T6SS encoded in SPI-6 (T6SSSPI-6), which contributes to the ability of Salmonella to colonize mice. On the other hand, serotype Gallinarum harbors a T6SS encoded in SPI-19 (T6SSSPI-19) that is required for colonization of chicks. In this work, we investigated the role of T6SSSPI-6 in infection of chicks by S. Typhimurium. Oral infection of White Leghorn chicks showed that a $\Delta$T6SSSPI-6 mutant had reduced colonization of the gut and internal organs, compared with the wild-type strain. Transfer of the intact T6SSSPI-6 gene cluster into the T6SS mutant restored bacterial colonization. In addition, our results showed that transfer of T6SSSPI-19 from S. Gallinarum to the $\Delta$T6SSSPI-6 mutant of S. Typhimurium not only complemented the colonization defect but also resulted in a transient increase in the colonization of the cecum and ileum of chicks at days 1 and 3 post-infection. Our data indicates that T6SSSPI-6 contributes to chicken colonization and suggests that both T6SSSPI-6 and T6SSSPI-19 perform similar functions in vivo despite belonging to different phylogenetic families.},

Expert users are sometimes interested in evaluating the quality of modeling programs rather than the quality of the models themselves.

abstract = {Proteins containing GGDEF domains are encoded in the majority of sequenced bacterial genomes. In several species, these proteins have been implicated in biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides, formation of biofilms, establishment of a sessile lifestyle, surface motility, and regulation of gene expression. However, biochemical activities of only a few GGDEF domain proteins have been tested. These proteins were shown to be involved in either synthesis or hydrolysis of cyclic-bis(3'--{\textgreater}5') dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) or in hydrolysis of cyclic AMP. To investigate specificity of the GGDEF domains in Bacteria, six GGDEF domain-encoding genes from randomly chosen representatives of diverse branches of the bacterial phylogenetic tree, i.e., Thermotoga, Deinococcus-Thermus, Cyanobacteria, spirochetes, and alpha and gamma divisions of the Proteobacteria, were cloned and overexpressed. All recombinant proteins were purified and found to possess diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity involved in c-di-GMP synthesis. The individual GGDEF domains from two proteins were overexpressed, purified, and shown to possess a low level of DGC activity. The oligomeric states of full-length proteins and individual GGDEF domains were similar. This suggests that GGDEF domains are sufficient to encode DGC activity; however, enzymatic activity is highly regulated by the adjacent sensory protein domains. It is shown that DGC activity of the GGDEF domain protein Rrp1 from Borrelia burgdorferi is strictly dependent on phosphorylation status of its input receiver domain. This study establishes that majority of GGDEF domain proteins are c-di-GMP specific, that c-di-GMP synthesis is a wide-spread phenomenon in Bacteria, and that it is highly regulated.},

abstract = {Bacteria in the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are highly pathogenic to insects and are symbiotically associated with nematodes in the genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, respectively. We compared extracellular protease production and resistance to antibiotics (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, neomycin and tetracycline) for 32 isolates of P. luminescens and 11 isolates of X. poinarii taken from nematodes isolated from soil in southern New Jersey. P. luminescens produced greater amounts of protease, and was more resistant to erythromycin and less resistant to neomycin than X. poinarii. No interspecific differences in resistance to chloramphenicol or tetracycline were detected. Variability within species was not related to the site, habitat or soil core from which the isolates were obtained, and was not associated with variation in the color of the host cadaver for P. luminescens. Resistance to erythromycin was positively correlated with resistance to both neomycin and tetracycline for P. luminescens, but was negatively correlated with resistance to neomycin for X. poinarii. Antibiotic resistance profiles and extracellular protease production might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably have ecological significance with respect to intra- and interspecific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control.},

abstract = {A variety of bacterial pathogenicity determinants, including the type VI secretion system and the virulence cassettes from Photorhabdus and Serratia, share an evolutionary origin with contractile-tailed myophages. The well-characterized Escherichia coli phage P2 provides an excellent system for studies related to these systems, as its protein composition appears to represent the "minimal" myophage tail. In this study, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of gpX, a 68-residue tail baseplate protein. Although the sequence and structure of gpX are similar to those of LysM domains, which are a large family associated with peptidoglycan binding, we did not detect a peptidoglycan-binding activity for gpX. However, bioinformatic analysis revealed that half of all myophages, including all that possess phage T4-like baseplates, encode a tail protein with a LysM-like domain, emphasizing a widespread role for this domain in baseplate function. While phage P2 gpX comprises only a single LysM domain, many myophages display LysM domain fusions with other tail proteins, such as the DNA circulation protein found in Mu-like phages and gp53 of T4-like phages. Electron microscopy of P2 phage particles with an incorporated gpX-maltose binding protein fusion revealed that gpX is located at the top of the baseplate, near the junction of the baseplate and tail tube. gpW, the orthologue of phage T4 gp25, was also found to localize to this region. A general colocalization of LysM-like domains and gpW homologues in diverse phages is supported by our bioinformatic analysis.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli gene pair mazEF is a regulatable chromosomal toxin-antitoxin module: mazF encodes a stable toxin and mazE encodes for a labile antitoxin that overcomes the lethal effect of MazF. Because MazE is labile, inhibition of mazE expression results in cell death. We studied the effect of mazEF on the development of bacteriophage P1 upon thermoinduction of the prophage P1CM c1ts and upon infection with virulent phage particles (P1vir). In several E. coli strains, we showed that the Delta mazEF derivative strains produced significantly more phages than did the parent strain. In addition, upon induction of K38(P1CM c1ts), nearly all of the Delta mazEF mutant cells lysed; in contrast, very few of the parental mazEF + K38 cells underwent lysis. However, most of these cells did not remain viable. Thus, while the Delta mazEF cells die as a result of the lytic action of the phage, most of the mazEF+ cells are killed by a different mechanism, apparently through the action of the chromosomal mazEF system itself. Furthermore, the introduction of lysogens into a growing non-lysogenic culture is lethal to Delta mazEF but not for mazEF+ cultures. Thus, although mazEF action causes individual cells to die, upon phage growth this is generally beneficial to the bacterial culture because it causes P1 phage exclusion from the bacterial population. These results provide additional support for the view that bacterial cultures may share some of the characteristics of multicellular organisms.},

The concentration of the bactericidal substance increased significantly after induction by mitomycin C. Purification was effected by salt fractionation, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, and sedimentation by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 90 min. Electron microscopy of this purified preparation revealed structures resembling R-type pyocins in both the contracted and uncontracted state. Pyocins in the contracted state were observed in association with the gonococcal cell surface. No loss of bactericidal activity was observed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Standard pyocin typing procedures identified the pyocin pattern as 611 131. The bactericidal activity of this pyocin was examined on various species of Neisseria. Out of 56 strains of N. gonorrhoeae from disseminated and nondisseminated infections, all were susceptible to pyocin 611 131. However, only 3 of 20 strains of N. meningitidis and 5 of 16 strains of N. lactamica were susceptible. The bactericidal activity that pyocin 611 131 has for N. gonorrhoeae and other species of Neisseria is significant because it departs from the expected specificity that heretofore has distinguished bacteriocins from most "classical" antibiotics.},

abstract = {RNA polymerase is a target for numerous regulatory events in all living cells. Recent studies identified a few "hot spots" on the surface of bacterial RNA polymerase that mediate its interactions with diverse accessory proteins. Prominent among these hot spots, the beta' subunit clamp helices serve as a major binding site for the initiation factor sigma and for the elongation factor RfaH. Furthermore, the two proteins interact with the nontemplate DNA strand in transcription complexes and thus may interfere with each other's activity. We show that RfaH does not inhibit transcription initiation but, once recruited to RNA polymerase, abolishes sigma-dependent pausing. We argue that this apparent competition is due to a steric exclusion of sigma by RfaH that is stably bound to the nontemplate DNA and clamp helices, both of which are necessary for the sigma recruitment to the transcription complex. Our findings highlight the key regulatory role played by the clamp helices during both initiation and elongation stages of transcription.},

abstract = {Very diverse research fields frequently deal with the analysis of multiple clustering results, which should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences between the formed groupings. The congruence between these multiple results can be quantified by clustering comparison measures such as the Wallace coefficient (W). Since the measured congruence is dependent on the particular sample taken from the population, there is variability in the estimated values relatively to those of the true population. In the present work we propose the use of a confidence interval (CI) to account for this variability when W is used. The CI analytical formula is derived assuming a Gaussian sampling distribution and recurring to the algebraic relationship between W and the Simpson's index of diversity. This relationship also allows the estimation of the expected Wallace value under the assumption of independence of classifications. We evaluated the CI performance using simulated and published microbial typing data sets. The simulations showed that the CI has the desired 95{\%} coverage when the W is greater than 0.5. This behaviour is robust to changes in cluster number, cluster size distributions and sample size. The analysis of the published data sets demonstrated the usefulness of the new CI by objectively validating some of the previous interpretations, while showing that other conclusions lacked statistical support.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the common properties of tailed phages and potential criteria for their classification as an order and situating tailed phages with respect to other viruses. Tailed bacteriophages have a common origin and constitute an order with three families, named Caudovirales. Their structured tail is unique. Tailed phages share a series of high-level taxonomic properties and show many facultative features that are unique or rare in viruses—for example, tail appendages and unusual bases. They share with other viruses, especially herpesviruses, elements of morphogenesis and lifestyle that are attributed to convergent evolution. Tailed phages present three types of lysogeny, exemplified by phages $\lambda$, Mu, and P1. Lysogeny appears as a secondary property acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Amino acid sequence alignments (notably of DNA polymerases, integrases, and peptidoglycan hydrolases) indicate frequent events of horizontal gene transfer in tailed phages. Common capsid and tail proteins have not been detected. Present-day tailed phages appear as chimeras, but their monophyletic origin is still inscribed in their morphology, genome structure, and replication strategy. It may also be evident in the three-dimensional structure of capsid and tail proteins. It is unlikely to be found in amino acid sequences because constitutive proteins must be so old that relationships were obliterated and most or all replication-, lysogeny-, and lysis-related proteins appear to have been borrowed.},

A type VI secretion system (T6SS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to deliver cell wall-targeting effectors to neighboring cells. However, the generality of bacteriolytic effectors and, moreover, of antibacterial T6S remained unknown. Using parameters derived from experimentally validated bacterial T6SS effectors we identified a phylogenetically disperse superfamily of T6SS-associated peptidoglycan-degrading effectors. The effectors separate into four families composed of peptidoglycan amidase enzymes of differing specificities. Effectors strictly co-occur with cognate immunity proteins, indicating that self-intoxication is a general property of antibacterial T6SSs and effector delivery by the system exerts a strong selective pressure in nature. The presence of antibacterial effectors in a plethora of organisms, including many that inhabit or infect polymicrobial niches in the human body, suggests that the system could mediate interbacterial interactions of both environmental and clinical significance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the various proteins constituting tailed bacteriophages from a structural viewpoint. To this end, we had in mind to pinpoint the resemblances within and between functional modules such as capsid/tail connectors, the tails themselves, or the tail distal host recognition devices, termed baseplates. This comparison has been extended to bacterial machineries embedded in the cell wall, for which shared molecular homology with phages has been recently revealed. This is the case for the type VI secretion system (T6SS), an inverted phage tail at the bacterial surface, or bacteriocins. Gathering all these data, we propose that a unique ancestral protein fold may have given rise to a large number of bacteriophage modules as well as to some related bacterial machinery components.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is extensively utilized for determining the percentages of secondary structure content present in proteins. However, although a large contributor, secondary structure is not the only factor that influences the shape and magnitude of the CD spectrum produced. Other structural features can make contributions so an entire protein structural conformation can give rise to a CD spectrum. There is a need for an application capable of generating protein CD spectra from atomic coordinates, but no empirically-derived method to do this currently exists. RESULTS PDB2CD has been created as an empirical-based approach to the generation of protein CD spectra from atomic coordinates. The method utilizes a combination of structural features within the conformation of a protein; not only its percentage secondary structure content, but also the juxtaposition of these structural components relative to one another, and the overall structure similarity of the query protein to proteins in our data set. A significant number of the CD spectra associated with the 71 proteins in the SP175 data set, the "gold standard" set obtained from the Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank (PCDDB), have been produced with excellent accuracy using a leave-one-out cross-validation process. The method also creates spectra in good agreement with those of a test set of 14 proteins from the PCDDB. The PDB2CD package provides a web-based, user friendly approach to enable researchers to produce CD spectra from protein atomic coordinates.

abstract = {The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a supra-molecular complex akin to bacteriophage tails, with VgrG proteins acting as a puncturing device. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa H1-T6SS has been extensively characterized. It is involved in bacterial killing and in the delivery of three toxins, Tse1-3. Here, we demonstrate the independent contribution of the three H1-T6SS co-regulated vgrG genes, vgrG1abc, to bacterial killing. A putative toxin is encoded in the vicinity of each vgrG gene, supporting the concept of specific VgrG/toxin couples. In this respect, VgrG1c is involved in the delivery of an Rhs protein, RhsP1. The RhsP1 C terminus carries a toxic activity, from which the producing bacterium is protected by a cognate immunity. Similarly, VgrG1a-dependent toxicity is associated with the PA0093 gene encoding a two-domain protein with a putative toxin domain (Toxin{\_}61) at the C terminus. Finally, VgrG1b-dependent killing is detectable upon complementation of a triple vgrG1abc mutant. The VgrG1b-dependent killing is mediated by PA0099, which presents the characteristics of the superfamily nuclease 2 toxin members. Overall, these data develop the concept that VgrGs are indispensable components for the specific delivery of effectors. Several additional vgrG genes are encoded on the P. aeruginosa genome and are not linked genetically to other T6SS genes. A closer inspection of these clusters reveals that they also encode putative toxins. Overall, these associations further support the notion of an original form of secretion system, in which VgrG acts as the carrier.},

We have now reconstructed the T4 tail tube at a resolution of 3.4 {\AA}, more than a 1,000-fold increase in information content for the tube from 1968. We have used legacy software (Spider) to show that we can do better than the typical 2/3 Nyquist frequency.

All three methods are compared and it is shown that both the variable selection method and the improved Provencher and Gl{\"{o}}ckner methods have equivalent reliability superior to the original Hennessey and Johnson method. For the new variable selection method, correlation coefficients calculated between X-ray structure and predicted secondary structures for data measured to 178 nm are: 0.97 for alpha-helix, 0.75 for beta-sheet, 0.50 for beta-turn, and 0.89 for other structures. Although the variable selection method improves the analysis of circular dichroism data truncated at 190 nm, data measured to 178 nm gives superior results. It is shown that improving the fit to the measured CD beyond the accuracy of the data can result in poorer analyses.},

abstract = {Recombineering allows DNA cloned in Escherichia coli to be modified via lambda (lambda) Red-mediated homologous recombination, obviating the need for restriction enzymes and DNA ligases to modify DNA. Here, we describe the construction of three new recombineering strains (SW102, SW105 and SW106) that allow bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to be modified using galK positive/negative selection. This two-step selection procedure allows DNA to be modified without introducing an unwanted selectable marker at the modification site. All three strains contain an otherwise complete galactose operon, except for a precise deletion of the galK gene, and a defective temperature-sensitive lambda prophage that makes recombineering possible. SW105 and SW106 cells in addition carry l-arabinose-inducible Cre or Flp genes, respectively. The galK function can be selected both for and against. This feature greatly reduces the background seen in other negative-selection schemes, and galK selection is considerably more efficient than other related selection methods published. We also show how galK selection can be used to rapidly introduce point mutations, deletions and loxP sites into BAC DNA and thus facilitate functional studies of SNP and/or disease-causing point mutations, the identification of long-range regulatory elements and the construction of conditional targeting vectors.},

When faced with the need to compare large numbers of large trees, however, even linear time becomes pro-hibitive. We present a randomized approximation scheme that provides, in sublinear time and with high probability, a .1 C "/ approximation of the true RF metric. Our approach is to use a sublinear-space embedding of the trees, combined with an application of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma to approximate vector norms very rapidly. We complement our algorithm by presenting an efficient embedding procedure, thereby resolving an open issue from the preliminary version of this paper. We have also improved the performance of Day's (exact) algorithm in practice by using techniques discovered while implementing our approximation scheme. Indeed, we give a unified framework for edge-based tree algorithms in which implementation tradeoffs are clear. Finally, we present detailed experimental re-sults illustrating the precision and running-time tradeoffs as well as demonstrating the speed of our approach.

The structure of the trans-membrane complex has been deciphered using a combination of X-ray crystallography and EM.

Recently, group B adenovirus derivatives have gained interest as attractive gene therapy vectors because they can transduce target tissues, such as hematopoietic stem cells, dendritic cells and malignant tumor cells, that are refractory to infection by commonly used adenoviral vectors. Whereas many adenoviruses infect cells through the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), group B adenoviruses use an alternate, as-yet-unidentified cellular attachment receptor. Using mass spectrometric analysis of proteins interacting with a group B fiber, we identified human CD46 as a cellular attachment receptor for most group B adenoviruses. We show that ectopic expression of human CD46 rendered nonhuman cells susceptible to infection with group B viruses in vitro and in vivo. In addition, both siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD46 and a soluble form of CD46 blocked infection of human cell lines and primary human cells. The discovery that group B adenoviruses use CD46, a ubiquitously expressed complement regulatory protein, as a cellular attachment receptor elucidates the diverse clinical manifestation of group B virus infections, and bears directly on the application of these vectors for gene therapy.},

An important source of inspiration for the creation of such proteins are natural fibrous proteins such as collagen, elastin, insect silks, and fibers from phages and viruses. The fibrous parts of this last class of proteins usually adopt trimeric, {\$}\beta{\$}-stranded structural folds and are appended to globular, receptor-binding domains. It has been recently shown that the globular domains are essential for correct folding and trimerization and can be successfully substituted by a very small (27-amino acid) trimerization motif from phage T4 fibritin. The hybrid proteins are correctly folded nanorods that can withstand extreme conditions. When the fibrous part derives from the adenovirus fiber shaft, different tissue-targeting specificities can be engineered into the hybrid proteins, which therefore can be used as gene therapy vectors. The integration of such stable nanorods in devices is also a big challenge in the field of biomechanical design. The fibritin foldon domain is a versatile trimerization motif and can be combined with a variety of fibrous motifs, such as coiled-coil, collagenous, and triple {\$}\beta{\$}-stranded motifs, provided the appropriate linkers are used. The combination of different motifs within the same fibrous molecule to create stable rods with multiple functions can even be envisioned. We provide a comprehensive overview of the experimental procedures used for designing, creating, and characterizing hybrid fibrous nanorods using the fibritin trimerization motif.},

It is a homohexameric protein that recognizes and binds preferably to C-rich sites in the transcribed RNA. Once bound to RNA, it utilizes RNA-dependent ATPase activity and subsequently ATPase-dependent helicase activity to unwind RNA-DNA hybrids and release RNA from a transcribing elongation complex. Studies over the past few decades have highlighted Rho as a molecule and have revealed much of its mechanistic properties. The recently solved crystal structure could explain many of its physiological functions in terms of its structure. Despite all these efforts, many of the fundamental questions pertaining to Rho recognition sites, differential ATPase activity in response to different RNAs, translocation of Rho along the nascent transcript, interactions with elongation complex and finally unwinding and release of RNA remain obscure. In the present review we have attempted to summarize "the knowns" and "the unknowns" of the Rho protein revealed by the recent developments in this field. An attempt has also been made to understand the physiology of Rho in the light of its phylogeny.},

abstract = {A recombination system has been developed for efficient chromosome engineering in Escherichia coli by using electroporated linear DNA. A defective lambda prophage supplies functions that protect and recombine an electroporated linear DNA substrate in the bacterial cell. The use of recombination eliminates the requirement for standard cloning as all novel joints are engineered by chemical synthesis in vitro and the linear DNA is efficiently recombined into place in vivo. The technology and manipulations required are simple and straightforward. A temperature-dependent repressor tightly controls prophage expression, and, thus, recombination functions can be transiently supplied by shifting cultures to 42 degrees C for 15 min. The efficient prophage recombination system does not require host RecA function and depends primarily on Exo, Beta, and Gam functions expressed from the defective lambda prophage. The defective prophage can be moved to other strains and can be easily removed from any strain. Gene disruptions and modifications of both the bacterial chromosome and bacterial plasmids are possible. This system will be especially useful for the engineering of large bacterial plasmids such as those from bacterial artificial chromosome libraries.},

abstract = {In gram-negative bacteria, type I secretion is carried out by a translocator made up of three proteins that span the cell envelope. One of these proteins is a specific outer membrane protein (OMP) and the other two are cytoplasmic membrane proteins: an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and the so-called membrane fusion or adaptor protein (MFP). Type I secretion is sec-independent and bypasses the periplasm. This widespread pathway allows the secretion of proteins of diverse sizes and functions via a C-terminal uncleaved secretion signal. This C-terminal secretion signal specifically recognizes the ABC protein, triggering the assembly of the functional trans-envelope complex. This report will mainly deal will recent data concerning the structure and assembly of the secretion complex as well as the effects and role of substrate folding on secretion by this pathway. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Protein secretion is a basic cellular function found in organisms of all kingdoms of life. Gram-negative bacteria have evolved a remarkable number of pathways for the transport of proteins across the cell envelope. The secretion systems fulfill general cellular functions but are also essential for pathogenic bacteria during the interaction with eukaryotic host cells. Secretion systems range from relatively simple structures such as type I secretion systems composed of three subunits that only secrete one substrate protein to complex machines such as type III and IV secretion systems composed of more than 20 subunits that can translocate large sets of effector proteins into eukaryotic target cells. In this review, the main structural and functional features of secretion systems are described. One subgroup of substrate proteins of secretion systems are protein adhesins. Despite the conserved function in binding to host cell ligands or to abiotic surfaces, the assembly of the various bacterial adhesins is highly divergent. Here we give an overview on the recent understanding of the assembly of fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins and the role of type I, III and V secretion systems and specialized branches of the general secretion pathway in their biogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

The fraction of the each secondary structure in a protein is predicted by forming the dot product of the corresponding inverse CD spectrum, expressed as a vector, with the CD spectrum of the protein digitized in the same way. We show how this method is based on the construction of the generalized inverse from the singular value decomposition of a set of CD spectra corresponding to proteins whose secondary structures are known from X-ray crystallography. These inverse spectra compute secondary structure directly from protein CD spectra without resorting to least-squares fitting and standard matrix inversion techniques. In addition, spectra corresponding to the individual secondary structures, analogous to the CD spectra of synthetic polypeptides, are generated from the five most significant CD eigenvectors.},

abstract = {The cupin superfamily of proteins, named on the basis of a conserved $\beta$-barrel fold ('cupa' is the Latin term for a small barrel), was originally discovered using a conserved motif found within germin and germin-like proteins from higher plants. Previous analysis of cupins had identified some 18 different functional classes that range from single-domain bacterial enzymes such as isomerases and epimerases involved in the modification of cell wall carbohydrates, through to two-domain bicupins such as the desiccation-tolerant seed storage globulins, and multidomain transcription factors including one linked to the nodulation response in legumes. Recent advances in comparative genomics, and the resolution of many more 3-D structures have now revealed that the largest subset of the cupin superfamily is the 2-oxyglutarate-Fe2+dependent dioxygenases. The substrates for this subclass of enzyme are many and varied and in total amount to probably 50-100 different biochemical reactions, including several involved in plant growth and development. Although the majority of enzymatic cupins contain iron as an active site metal, other members contain either copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel or manganese ions as a cofactor, with each cofactor allowing a different type of chemistry to occur within the conserved tertiary structure. This review discusses the range of structures and functions found in this most diverse of superfamilies. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The system uses lambda-Red mediated recombineering accompanied by the introduction of double-strand DNA breaks in the chromosome and a donor plasmid bearing the desired insertion fragment. Our method, in contrast to existing recombineering or phage-derived insertion methods, allows for the insertion of very large fragments into any desired location and in any orientation. We demonstrate this method by inserting a 7-kb fragment consisting of a venus-tagged lac repressor gene along with a target lacZ reporter into six unique sites distributed symmetrically about the chromosome. We also demonstrate the universality and repeatability of the method by separately inserting the lac repressor gene and the lacZ target into the chromosome at separate locations around the chromosome via repeated application of the protocol.},

abstract = {The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) delivers protein effectors to diverse cell types including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, therefore it participates in inter-bacterial competition and pathogenesis. The T6SS is constituted of an envelope-spanning complex anchoring a cytoplasmic tubular edifice. This tubular structure is evolutionarily, functionally and structurally related to the tail of contractile phages. It is composed of an inner tube tipped by a spike complex, and engulfed within a sheath-like structure. This structure assembles onto a platform called "baseplate" that is connected to the membrane sub-complex. The T6SS functions as a nano-crossbow: upon contraction of the sheath, the inner tube is propelled towards the target cell, allowing effector delivery. This review focuses on the architecture and biogenesis of this fascinating secretion machine, highlighting recent advances regarding the assembly of the membrane or tail complexes.

We have developed an automatic algorithm, RADAR, for segmenting a query sequence into repeats. The segmentation procedure has three steps: (i) repeat length is determined by the spacing between suboptimal self-alignment traces; (ii) repeat borders are optimized to yield a maximal integer number of repeats, and (iii) distant repeats are validated by iterative profile alignment. The method identifies short composition biased as well as gapped approximate repeats and complex repeat architectures involving many different types of repeats in the query sequence. No manual intervention and no prior assumptions on the number and length of repeats are required. Comparison to the Pfam-A database indicates good coverage, accurate alignments, and reasonable repeat borders. Screening the Swissprot database revealed 3,000 repeats not annotated in existing domain databases. A number of these repeats had been described in the literature but most were novel. This illustrates how in times when curated databases grapple with ever increasing backlogs, automatic (re)analysis of sequences provides an efficient way to capture this important information.},

abstract = {Adenovirus fibres are trimeric proteins that consist of a globular C-terminal domain, a central fibrous shaft and an N-terminal part that attaches to the viral capsid. In the presence of the globular C-terminal domain, which is necessary for correct trimerisation, the shaft segment adopts a triple beta-spiral conformation. We have replaced the head of the fibre by the trimerisation domain of the bacteriophage T4 fibritin, the foldon. Two different fusion constructs were made and crystallised, one with an eight amino acid residue linker and one with a linker of only two residues.X-ray crystallographic studies of both fusion proteins shows that residues 319-391 of the adenovirus type 2 fibre shaft fold into a triple beta-spiral fold indistinguishable from the native structure, although this is now resolved at a higher resolution of 1.9 . The foldon residues 458-483 also adopt their natural structure. The intervening linkers are not well ordered in the crystal structures.This work shows that the shaft sequences retain their capacity to fold into their native beta-spiral fibrous fold when fused to a foreign C-terminal trimerisation motif. It provides a structural basis to artificially trimerise longer adenovirus shaft segments and segments from other trimeric beta-structured fibre proteins. Such artificial fibrous constructs, amenable to crystallisation and solution studies, can offer tractable model systems for the study of beta-fibrous structure. They can also prove useful for gene therapy and fibre engineering applications. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Assembly of tail fibers of coliphage T4 requires the action of helper proteins. In the absence of one of these, protein 38 (p38), p37, constituting the distal part of the long tail fiber, fails to oligomerize. In the absence of the other, p57, p34 (another component of the long tail fiber), p37, and p12 (the subunit of the short tail fiber) remain unassembled. p38 can be replaced by the Tfa (tail fiber assembly) protein (pTfa) of phage ␭, which has the advantage of remaining soluble even when produced in massive amounts. The mechanisms of action of the helpers are unknown. As a first step towards elucidation of these mechanisms, p57 and pTfa have been purified to homogeneity and have been crystallized. The identity of gene 57 (g57), not known with certainty previously, has been established. The 79-residue protein p57 represents a very exotic polypeptide. It is oligomeric and acidic (an excess of nine negative charges). It does not contain Phe, Trp, Tyr, His, Pro, and Cys. Only 25 N-terminal residues were still able to complement a g57 amber mutant, although with a reduced efficiency. In cells overproducing the protein, it assumed a quasi-crystalline structure in the form of highly ordered fibers. They traversed the cells longitudinally (and thus blocked cell division) with a diameter approaching that of the cell and with a hexagonal appearance. The 194-residue pTfa is also acidic (an excess of 13 negative charges) and is likely to be dimeric. Receptors at the bacterial cell surface are recognized by phage T4 with the free ends of its long tail fibers (1, 26, 51). These fibers consist of four proteins: p34, p35, p36, and p37. p37 constitutes the distal part of the fiber and mediates recep-tor recognition (2, 51) with an area near its C terminus (17, 32). p34, p36, and p37 in these tail fibers are oligomers. It had earlier been assumed that they form dimers (50, 53); most likely, however, they are trimers. There is experimental evi-dence for the trimeric state of p34 and p37 (8), and regarding p37, strong indirect evidence stems from the fact that the tail fibers of phage T7 consist of trimers of this virion's p17 (49). Tail fiber genes are of a mosaic structure (summarized in reference 16), very strongly indicating horizontal transfer of gene fragments. Corresponding protein fragments, partially identical to sequences of p17, exist in p37 of phages K3 and T2 (16), which are very closely related to T4. There is little doubt, therefore that all p37 proteins are trimeric. Assembly of these fibers requires helpers (for a recent review, see reference 54), which are absent from the mature virion. In the absence of one of these, p38, p37 fails to oligomerize. A gene 38 (g38) partial bypass mutant has been isolated (3), and it has been shown to consist of a duplication of residues 797 to 805 (17) of the 1,026-residue p37 (36). This is the area where p38 is believed to act on p37 (48). Infection with the mutant phage leads to about 30{\%} assembled distal half-fibers (compared with the amount produced in wild-type phage infection); hence, the bypass strongly suggests that p38 does not catalyze a covalent modification of p37 which would be required for assembly. p38 most likely acts as a specific chaperone (for reviews, see ref-erences 12 and 13), because, e.g., PapD is acting only in the bacterial pilus assembly (23). In line with this view is the recent demonstration that, depending on the type of p38 present, the folding pathway and the receptor specificity of p37 can differ, and we have suggested that this chaperone acts instructively (17). The thus rather interesting mechanism of action of p38 has remained unknown. The protein has not been purified, and the instability of its activity in extracts has hampered further study (53). The role of the other helper, p57, has remained entirely mysterious. Absence of p57 had pleiotropic effects: p34, p37, and p12, the subunit of the short tail fibers, remained unassembled (27, 50). p57 bypass mutants have also been iso-lated; they were located in the chromosome of the host (39), but their nature is not known. Oddly enough, even the identity of g57 has not been established beyond doubt. In order to eventually understand the mechanism of action of the two helpers, it is our aim to develop an in vitro system consisting of the helpers and monomeric p37. This is not hope-less because it is possible in vivo. It has been shown that upon infection with a mutant phage carrying, among others, defec-tive genes g34 and g36, p37 half-fibers were produced which were able to bind to a receptor for T4, the outer membrane's lipopolysaccharide (52). Here we report the isolation and some properties of a ho-molog of p38, pTfa (tail fiber assembly protein) of phage ␭, which can functionally replace p38 of T4 (33) and which, as we show here, can be replaced by p38. pTfa was chosen because, in contrast to p38, it remains soluble even when overproduced in massive quantities. g57 has been identified, and the rather unusual p57 has been isolated. Some of p57's properties are described.},

abstract = {Protein secretion systems are vital for prokaryotic life, as they enable bacteria to acquire nutrients, communicate with other species, defend against biological and chemical agents, and facilitate disease through the delivery of virulence factors. In this review, we will focus on the recently discovered type IX secretion system (T9SS), a complex translocon found only in some species of theBacteroidetesphylum. T9SS plays two roles, depending on the lifestyle of the bacteria. It provides either a means of movement (called gliding motility) for peace-loving environmental bacteria or a weapon for pathogens. The best-studied members of these two groups areFlavobacterium johnsoniae, a commensal microorganism often found in water and soil, andPorphyromonas gingivalis, a human oral pathogen that is a major causative agent of periodontitis. InP. gingivalisand some other periodontopathogens, T9SS translocates proteins, especially virulence factors, across the outer membrane (OM). Proteins destined for secretion bear a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that directs the cargo to the OM translocon. At least 18 proteins are involved in this still enigmatic process, with some engaged in the post-translational modification of T9SS cargo proteins. Upon translocation across the OM, the CTD is removed by a protease with sortase-like activity and an anionic LPS is attached to the newly formed C-terminus. As a result, a cargo protein could be secreted into the extracellular milieu or covalently attached to the bacterial surface. T9SS is regulated by a two-component system; however, the precise environmental signal that triggers it has not been identified. Exploring unknown systems contributing to bacterial virulence is exciting, as it may eventually lead to new therapeutic strategies. During the past decade, the major components of T9SS were identified, as well as hints suggesting the possible mechanism of action. In addition, the list of characterized cargo proteins is constantly growing. The actual structure of the translocon, situated in the OM of bacteria, remains the least explored area; however, new technical approaches and increasing scientific attention have resulted in a growing body of data. Therefore, we present a compact up-to-date review of this topic.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria have evolved several secretory pathways to release enzymes or toxins into the surrounding environment or into the target cells. The type II secretion system (T2SS) is conserved in Gram-negative bacteria and involves a set of 12 to 16 different proteins. Components of the T2SS are located in both the inner and outer membranes where they assemble into a supramolecular complex spanning the bacterial envelope, also called the secreton. The T2SS substrates transiently go through the periplasm before they are translocated across the outer membrane and exposed to the extracellular milieu. The T2SS is unique in its ability to promote secretion of large and sometimes multimeric proteins that are folded in the periplasm. The present review describes recently identified protein-protein interactions together with structural and functional advances in the field that have contributed to improve our understanding on how the type II secretion apparatus assembles and on the role played by individual proteins of this highly sophisticated system.},

abstract = {Prophage sequences became an integral part of bacterial genomes as a consequence of coevolution, encoding fitness or virulence factors. Such roles have been attributed to phage-derived elements identified in several Gram-negative species: The type VI secretion system (T6SS), the R- and F-type pyocins, and the newly discovered Serratia entomophila antifeeding prophage (Afp), and the Photorhabdus luminescens virulence cassette (PVC). In this study, we provide evidence that remarkably conserved gene clusters, homologous to Afp/PVC, are not restricted to Gram-negative bacteria but are widespread throughout all prokaryotes including the Archaea. Even though they are phylogenetically closer to pyocins, they share key characteristics in common with the T6SS, such as the use of a chaperon-type AAA+ ATPase and the lack of a host cell lysis mechanism. We thus suggest that Afp/PVC-like elements could be classified as phage-like-protein-translocation structures (PLTSs) rather than as pyocins. The reconstruction of phylogeny and the conserved gene content suggest that the diversification of prophage sequences to PLTS occurred in bacteria early in evolution and only once, but PLTS clusters have been horizontally transferred to some of the bacterial lineages and to the Archaea. The adaptation of this element in such a wide host range is suggestive of its versatile use in prokaryotes.},

abstract = {The first step in bacteriophage infection is recognition and binding to the host receptor, which is mediated by the phage receptor binding protein (RBP). Different RBPs can lead to differential host specificity. In many bacteriophages, such as Escherichia coli and Lactococcal phages, RBPs have been identified as the tail fiber or protruding baseplate proteins. However, the tail fiber-dependent host specificity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages has not been well studied. This study aimed to identify and investigate the binding specificity of the RBP of P. aeruginosa phages PaP1 and JG004. These two phages share high DNA sequence homology but exhibit different host specificities. A spontaneous mutant phage was isolated and exhibited broader host range compared with the parental phage JG004. Sequencing of its putative tail fiber and baseplate region indicated a single point mutation in ORF84 (a putative tail fiber gene), which resulted in the replacement of a positively charged lysine (K) by an uncharged asparagine (N). We further demonstrated that the replacement of the tail fiber gene (ORF69) of PaP1 with the corresponding gene from phage JG004 resulted in a recombinant phage that displayed altered host specificity. Our study revealed the tail fiber-dependent host specificity in P. aeruginosa phages and provided an effective tool for its alteration. These contributions may have potential value in phage therapy.},

Incongruence can occur for artefactual reasons, when we fail to recover the correct gene trees, or for biological reasons, when true gene trees are actually distinct from each other, and from the species tree. Horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) between genomes are an important process of bacterial evolution resulting in a substantial amount of phylogenetic conflicts between gene trees. We argue that the (bacterial) species tree is still a meaningful scientific concept even in the case of HGTs, and that reconstructing it is still a valid goal. We tentatively assess the amount of phylogenetic incongruence caused by HGTs in bacteria by comparing bacterial datasets to a metazoan dataset in which transfers are presumably very scarce or absent.We review existing phylogenomic methods and their ability to return to the user, both the vertical (speciation/extinction history) and horizontal (gene transfers) phylogenetic signals.},

Our approach, which capitalized upon the overall structural similarity between the human Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber and bacteriophage T4 fibritin proteins, has resulted in the generation of a genetically modified Ad5 incorporating chimeric fiber-fibritin proteins targeted to artificial receptor molecules.

The resulting PCR product is then electroporated into an Escherichia coli strain harboring both the phage lambda Red functions and the host plasmid. Upon homologous recombination of the PCR fragment into the plasmid, expression of a drug selection marker is fully induced due to restoration of its truncated promoter, thus allowing appropriate selection. Recombinant plasmid vectors encoding beta-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase were constructed by using this method in two well-known Red systems.

Here we generate and characterize an hfq deletion mutant and show that in the absence of hfq, the bacteria are no longer able to maintain a healthy symbiosis with nematodes due to the abolishment of the production of all known secondary metabolites.

Larval disease symptoms include cessation of feeding, clearance of the gut, amber coloration, and eventual death. A 115-kb plasmid, pADAP, identified in S. entomophila is required for disease causation and, when introduced into Escherichia coli, enables that organism to cause amber disease. A 23-kb fragment of pADAP that conferred disease-causing ability on E. coli and a pADAP-cured strain of S. entomophila was isolated. Using insertion mutagenesis, the pathogenicity determinants were mapped to a 17-kb region of the clone. Sequence analysis of the 17-kb region showed that the predicted products of three of the open reading frames (sepA, sepB, and sepC) showed significant sequence similarity to components of the insecticidal toxin produced by the bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. Transposon insertions in sepA, sepB, or sepC completely abolished both gut clearance and cessation of feeding on the 23-kb clone; when recombined back into pADAP, they abolished gut clearance but not cessation of feeding.

abstract = {Protein secretion systems are critical to bacterial virulence and interactions with other organisms. The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is found in many bacterial species and is used to target either eukaryotic cells or competitor bacteria. However, T6SS-secreted proteins have proven surprisingly elusive. Here, we identified two secreted substrates of the antibacterial T6SS from the opportunistic human pathogen, Serratia marcescens. Ssp1 and Ssp2, both encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, were confirmed as antibacterial toxins delivered by the T6SS. Four related proteins encoded around the Ssp proteins (‘Rap' proteins) included two specifically conferring self-resistance (‘immunity') against T6SS-dependent Ssp1 or Ssp2 toxicity. Biochemical characterization revealed specific, tight binding between cognate Ssp–Rap pairs, forming complexes of 2:2 stoichiometry. The atomic structures of two Rap proteins were solved, revealing a novel helical fold, dependent on a structural disulphide bond, a structural feature consistent with their functional localization. Homologues of the Serratia Ssp and Rap proteins are found encoded together within other T6SS gene clusters, thus they represent founder members of new families of T6SS-secreted and cognate immunity proteins. We suggest that Ssp proteins are the original substrates of the S. marcescens T6SS, before horizontal acquisition of other T6SS-secreted toxins. Molecular insight has been provided into how pathogens utilize antibacterial T6SSs to overcome competitors and succeed in polymicrobial niches.},

Morphologically it resembles the sheathed tail of bacteriophages such as T4, including a baseplate at one end. It also shares features with the type VI secretion systems. Cryo-electron micrographs of tilted Afp specimens (up to 60 degrees) were analyzed to determine the correct cyclic symmetry to overcome the limitation imposed by exclusively side views in nominally untilted specimens. An asymmetric reconstruction shows clear 6-fold cyclic symmetry contrary to a previous conclusion of 4-fold symmetry based on analysis of only the preferred side views (Sen, A., Rybakova, D., Hurst, M. R., and Mitra, A. K. (2010) J. Bacteriol. 192, 4522-4525). Electron tomography of negatively stained Afp revealed right-handed helical striations in many of the particles, establishing the correct hand. Higher quality micrographs of untilted specimens were processed to produce a reconstruction at 2.0-nm resolution with imposed 6-fold symmetry. The helical parameters of the sheath were determined to be 8.14 nm for the subunit rise along and 40.5° for the rotation angle around the helix. The sheath is similar to that of the T4 phage tail but with a different arrangement of the subdomain of the polymerizing sheath protein(s). The central tube is similar to the diameter and axial width of the Hcp1 hexamer of P. aeruginosa type VI secretion system. The tube extends through the baseplate into a needle resembling the "puncture device" of the T4 tail. The tube contains density that may be the toxin and/or a length-determining protein.},

abstract = {The recently identified type VI secretion system (T6SS) is implicated in the virulence of many gram-negative bacteria. Edwardsiella tarda is an important cause of hemorrhagic septicemia in fish and also gastro- and extra-intestinal infections in humans. The E. tardavirulent protein (EVP) gene cluster encodes a conserved T6SS which contains 16 open reading frames. EvpC is one of the three major EVP secreted proteins and shares high sequence similarity with Hcp1, a key T6SS virulence factor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. EvpC contributes to the virulence of E. tarda by playing an essential role in functional T6SS. Here, we report the crystal structure of EvpC from E. tarda PPD130/91 at a 2.8 A resolution, along with functional studies of the protein. EvpC has a beta-barrel domain with extended loops. The beta-barrel consists of 11 anti-parallel beta-strands with an alpha-helix located on one side. In solution, EvpC exists as a dimer at low concentration and as a hexamer at higher concentration. In the crystal, the symmetry related EvpC molecules form hexameric rings which stack together to form a tube similar to Hcp1. Structure based mutagenesis revealed that N-terminal negatively charged residues, Asp4, Glu15 and Glu26, and C-terminal positively charged residues, Lys161, Lys162 and Lys163, played crucial roles in the secretion of EvpC. Moreover, the localization study indicates the presence of wild type EvpC in cytoplasm, periplasm and secreted fractions, whereas the N-terminal and C-terminal mutants were found mostly in the periplasmic region and was completely absent in the secreted fraction. Results reported here provide insight into the structure, assembly and function of EvpC. Further, these findings can be extended to other EvpC homologs for understanding the mechanism of T6SS and targeting T6SS mediated virulence in gram-negative pathogens.},

In Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan is located in the periplasm, where it is protected from exogenous lytic enzymes by the outer membrane. Here we show that the type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches this barrier to deliver two effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, to the periplasm of recipient cells. In this compartment, the effectors hydrolyse peptidoglycan, thereby providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa cells in competition with other bacteria. To protect itself from lysis by Tse1 and Tse3, P. aeruginosa uses specific periplasmically localized immunity proteins. The requirement for these immunity proteins depends on intercellular self-intoxication through an active type VI secretion system, indicating a mechanism for export whereby effectors do not access donor cell periplasm in transit.},

Second, specialized hemocytes participate in phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign intruders in the hemolymph. Finally, the fat body, a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver, produces humoral response molecules including antimicrobial peptides.

abstract = {The AAA+ ATPases are enzymes containing a P-loop NTPase domain, and function as molecular chaperones, ATPase subunits of proteases, helicases or nucleic-acid-stimulated ATPases. All available sequences and structures of AAA+ protein domains were compared with the aim of identifying the definitive sequence and structure features of these domains and inferring the principal events in their evolution. An evolutionary classification of the AAA+ class was developed using standard phylogenetic methods, analysis of shared sequence and structural signatures, and similarity-based clustering. This analysis resulted in the identification of 26 major families within the AAA+ ATPase class. We also describe the position of the AAA+ ATPases with respect to the RecA/F1, helicase superfamilies I/II, PilT, and ABC classes of P-loop NTPases. The AAA+ class appears to have undergone an early radiation into the clamp-loader, DnaA/Orc/Cdc6, classic AAA, and "pre-sensor 1 $\beta$-hairpin" (PS1BH) clades. Within the PS1BH clade, chelatases, MoxR, YifB, McrB, Dynein-midasin, NtrC, and MCMs form a monophyletic assembly defined by a distinct insert in helix-2 of the conserved ATPase core, and additional helical segment between the core ATPase domain and the C-terminal $\alpha$-helical bundle. At least 6 distinct AAA+ proteins, which represent the different major clades, are traceable to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of extant cellular life. Additionally, superfamily III helicases, which belong to the PS1BH assemblage, were probably present at this stage in virus-like "selfish" replicons. The next major radiation, at the base of the two prokaryotic kingdoms, bacteria and archaea, gave rise to several distinct chaperones, ATPase subunits of proteases, DNA helicases, and transcription factors. The third major radiation, at the outset of eukaryotic evolution, contributed to the origin of several eukaryote-specific adaptations related to nuclear and cytoskeletal functions. The new relationships and previously undetected domains reported here might provide new leads for investigating the biology of AAA+ ATPases.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli hlyCABD operons encode the polypeptide component (HlyA) of an extracellular cytolytic toxin as well as proteins required for its acylation (HlyC) and sec-independent secretion (HlyBD). The E. coli protein RfaH is required for wild-type hemolysin expression at the level of hlyCABD transcript elongation (J. A. Leeds and R. A. Welch, J. Bacteriol. 178:1850-1857, 1996). RfaH is also required for the transcription of wild-type levels of mRNA from promoter-distal genes in the rfaQ-K, traY-Z, and rplK-rpoC gene clusters, supporting the role for RfaH in transcriptional elongation. All or portions of a common 39-bp sequence termed JUMPStart are present in the untranslated regions of RfaH-enhanced operons. In this study, we tested the model that the JUMPStart sequence and RfaH are part of the same functional pathway. We examined the effect of JUMPStart deletion mutations within the untranslated leader of a chromosomally derived hlyCABD operon on hly RNA and HlyA protein levels in either wild-type or rfaH null mutant E. coli. We also provide in vivo physical evidence that is consistent with RNA polymerase pausing at the wild-type JUMPStart sequences.},

abstract = {In the environment, bacteria compete with each other for nutrient availability or to extend their ecological niche. The type VI secretion system contributes to bacterial competition by the translocation of antibacterial effectors from predators into prey cells. The T6SS assembles a dynamic structure-the sheath-wrapped around a tube constituted of the Hcp protein. It has been proposed that by cycling between extended and contracted conformations the sheath acts as a crossbow to propel the Hcp tube toward the target cell. While the sheath dynamics have been studied in monocultures, the activity of the T6SS has not been recorded in presence of the prey. Here, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of cocultures demonstrates that prey cells are killed upon contact with predator cells. Additional experiments provide evidence that sheath contraction correlates with nearby cell fading and that prey lysis occurs within minutes after sheath contraction. The results support a model in which T6SS dynamics are responsible for T6SS effectors translocation into recipient cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

These systems are widespread in bacteria allowing them to infect eukaryotic cells and survive or replicate within them.

Genomic data suggest that T6SS exist in most bacteria that come into close contact with eukaryotic cells, including plant and animal pathogens. Many research groups are now investigating the underlying mechanisms and the way in which the effector proteins translocated through this machine subvert host defences.

These structures provide molecular snapshots of a twinned-pore translocation machinery in action. Unexpectedly, only one pore is used for secretion, while both usher protomers are used for chaperone-subunit complex recruitment. The translocating pore itself comprises 24 $\beta$ strands and is occluded by a folded plug domain, likely gated by a conformationally constrained $\beta$-hairpin.

With this rapid Red/ET recombination and gene complementation approach, efficient gene disruptions and gene replacements in the geldanamycin biosynthetic gene cluster have been successfully achieved. As an example, we describe here the creation of a ketoreductase 6 null mutation in an E. coli high-copy-number plasmid carrying gdmA2A3 from Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL3602 and the subsequent complementation of a gdmA2A3 deletion host with this plasmid to generate a novel geldanamycin analog.

They are virtually untreatable with currently known antibiotics. Phage therapy is considered as one of the possible approaches to the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. Difficulties in the implementation of phage therapy in medical practice are related, for example, to the insufficient number and diversity of virulent phages that are active against P. aeruginosa. Results of interaction of therapeutic phages with bacteria in different conditions and environments are studied insufficiently. A little is known about possible interactions of therapeutic phages with resident prophages and plasmids in clinical strains in the foci of infections. This chapter highlights the different approaches to solving these problems and possible ways to expand the diversity of therapeutic P. aeruginosa phages and organizational arrangements (as banks of phages) to ensure long-term use of phages in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

However, several terms related to secretion are used confusingly in the literature, and this is a topical issue in genomics and proteomics. Defining a secreted protein as actively translocated via a secretion system, here, we put into perspective that homologous translocation systems can result in radically different subcellular localizations of a secreted protein. We propose using standardized nomenclature for secretion systems from type I to type VIII for Gram-negative bacteria only, whereas the terms 'Sec' (secretion), 'Tat' (twin-arginine translocation), 'FEA' (flagella export apparatus), 'FPE' (fimbrilin-protein exporter), 'holin' (hole forming) and 'Wss' (WXG100 secretion system) should be applied to translocation systems across the cytoplasmic membrane of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, we discuss why the term 'exoproteome' should be favoured over 'secretome' when describing the subset of proteins present in the extracellular milieu. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The X-ray structure of Escherichia coli RfaH reported here reveals two domains. The N-terminal domain displays high similarity to that of NusG. In contrast, the $\alpha$-helical coiled-coil C domain, while retaining sequence similarity, is strikingly different from the $\beta$ barrel of NusG. To our knowledge, such an all-$\beta$ to all-$\alpha$ transition of the entire domain is the most extreme example of protein fold evolution known to date. Both N domains possess a vast hydrophobic cavity that is buried by the C domain in RfaH but is exposed in NusG. We propose that this cavity constitutes the RNA polymerase-binding site, which becomes unmasked in RfaH only upon sequence-specific binding to the nontemplate DNA strand that triggers domain dissociation. Finally, we argue that RfaH binds to the $\beta$′ subunit coiled coil, the major target site for the initiation $\sigma$ factors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, a thorough mutational analysis of the TMP from lactococcal phage TP901-1 (TMPTP901-1) was undertaken. We generated 56 mutants aimed at defining TMPTP901-1 domains that are essential for tail assembly and successful infection. Through analysis of the derived mutants, we determined that TP901-1 infectivity requires the N-terminal 154 aa residues, the C-terminal 60 residues and the first predicted hydrophobic region of TMPTP901-1 as a minimum. Furthermore, the role of TMPTP901-1 in tail length determination was visualized by electron microscopic imaging of TMP-deletion mutants. The inverse linear correlation between the extent of TMPTP901-1-encoding gene deletions and tail length of the corresponding virion provides an estimate of TMPTP901-1 regions interacting with the connector or involved in initiator complex formation. This study represents the most thorough characterisation of a TMP from a Gram-positive host-infecting phage and provides essential advances to understanding its role in virion assembly, morphology and infection.},

Current approaches to visualizing secondary structure provide an adequate platform for the conversion of static text-based representations to 2D images, but are limited in their offer of interactivity as well as their ability to display larger structures, multiple structures and pseudoknotted structures. RESULTS In this article, we present forna, a web-based tool for displaying RNA secondary structure which allows users to easily convert sequences and secondary structures to clean, concise and customizable visualizations. It supports, among other features, the simultaneous visualization of multiple structures, the display of pseudoknotted structures, the interactive editing of the displayed structures, and the automatic generation of secondary structure diagrams from PDB files. It requires no software installation apart from a modern web browser.

abstract = {Despite the prevalence of antisense transcripts in bacterial transcriptomes, little is known about how their synthesis is controlled. We report that a major function of the Escherichia coli termination factor Rho and its cofactor, NusG, is suppression of ubiquitous antisense transcription genome-wide. Rho binds C-rich unstructured nascent RNA (high C/G ratio) prior to its ATP-dependent dissociation of transcription complexes. NusG is required for efficient termination at minority subsets ({\~{}}20{\%}) of both antisense and sense Rho-dependent terminators with lower C/G ratio sequences. In contrast, a widely studied nusA deletion proposed to compromise Rho-dependent termination had no effect on antisense or sense Rho-dependent terminators in vivo. Global colocalization of the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) with Rho-dependent terminators and genetic interactions between hns and rho suggest that H-NS aids Rho in suppression of antisense transcription. The combined actions of Rho, NusG, and H-NS appear to be analogous to the Sen1-Nrd1-Nab3 and nucleosome systems that suppress antisense transcription in eukaryotes.},

Many pathogens use dedicated protein secretion systems to secrete virulence factors from the cytosol of the bacteria into host cells or the host environment. In general, bacterial protein secretion apparatuses can be divided into different classes, based on their structures, functions, and specificity. Some systems are conserved in all classes of bacteria and secrete a broad array of substrates, while others are only found in a small number of bacterial species and/or are specific to only one or a few proteins. In this chapter, we review the canonical features of several common bacterial protein secretion systems, as well as their roles in promoting the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Additionally, we address recent findings that indicate that the innate immune system of the host can detect and respond to the presence of protein secretion systems during mammalian infection.},

abstract = {The tail baseplate of bacteriophage T4 contains a structurally essential, three-domain protein encoded by gene 5 in which the middle domain possesses lysozyme activity. The gene 5 product (gp5) undergoes post-translational cleavage, allowing the resultant N-terminal domain (gp5*) to assemble into the baseplate as a trimer. The lysozyme activity of the undissociated cleaved gp5 is inhibited until infection has been initiated, when the C-terminal portion of the molecule is detached and the rest of the molecule dissociates into monomers. The 3D structure of the undissociated cleaved gp5, complexed with gp27 (another component of the baseplate), shows that it is a cell-puncturing device that functions to penetrate the outer cell membrane and to locally dissolve the periplasmic cell wall. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These systems are widespread in bacteria allowing them to infect eukaryotic cells and survive or replicate within them. A new secretion system, the type VI secretion system (T6SS), was recently described and characterized in several pathogens. Genomic data suggest that T6SS exist in most bacteria that come into close contact with eukaryotic cells, including plant and animal pathogens. Many research groups are now investigating the underlying mechanisms and the way in which the effector proteins translocated through this machine subvert host defences. This review provides an overview of our current knowledge about type VI secretion, focusing on gene regulation, components of the secretion machine, substrate secretion and the cellular consequences for the host cell.},

abstract = {Proteinaceous toxins are observed across all levels of inter-organismal and intra-genomic conflicts. These include recently discovered prokaryotic polymorphic toxin systems implicated in intra-specific conflicts. They are characterized by a remarkable diversity of C-terminal toxin domains generated by recombination with standalone toxin-coding cassettes. Prior analysis revealed a striking diversity of nuclease and deaminase domains among the toxin modules. We systematically investigated polymorphic toxin systems using comparative genomics, sequence and structure analysis. Polymorphic toxin systems are distributed across all major bacterial lineages and are delivered by at least eight distinct secretory systems. In addition to type-II, these include type-V, VI, VII (ESX), and the poorly characterized “Photorhabdus virulence cassettes (PVC)”, PrsW-dependent and MuF phage-capsid-like systems. We present evidence that trafficking of these toxins is often accompanied by autoproteolytic processing catalyzed by HINT, ZU5, PrsW, caspase-like, papain-like, and a novel metallopeptidase associated with the PVC system. We identified over 150 distinct toxin domains in these systems. These span an extraordinary catalytic spectrum to include 23 distinct clades of peptidases, numerous previously unrecognized versions of nucleases and deaminases, ADP-ribosyltransferases, ADP ribosyl cyclases, RelA/SpoT-like nucleotidyltransferases, glycosyltranferases and other enzymes predicted to modify lipids and carbohydrates, and a pore-forming toxin domain. Several of these toxin domains are shared with host-directed effectors of pathogenic bacteria. Over 90 families of immunity proteins might neutralize anywhere between a single to at least 27 distinct types of toxin domains. In some organisms multiple tandem immunity genes or immunity protein domains are organized into polyimmunity loci or polyimmunity proteins. Gene-neighborhood-analysis of polymorphic toxin systems predicts the presence of novel trafficking-related components, and also the organizational logic that allows toxin diversification through recombination. Domain architecture and protein-length analysis revealed that these toxins might be deployed as secreted factors, through directed injection, or via inter-cellular contact facilitated by filamentous structures formed by RHS/YD, filamentous hemagglutinin and other repeats. Phyletic pattern and life-style analysis indicate that polymorphic toxins and polyimmunity loci participate in cooperative behavior and facultative ‘cheating' in several ecosystems such as the human oral cavity and soil. Multiple domains from these systems have also been repeatedly transferred to eukaryotes and their viruses, such as the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses. Along with a comprehensive inventory of toxins and immunity proteins, we present several testable predictions regarding active sites and catalytic mechanisms of toxins, their processing and trafficking and their role in intra-specific and inter-specific interactions between bacteria. These systems provide insights regarding the emergence of key systems at different points in eukaryotic evolution, such as ADP ribosylation, interaction of myosin VI with cargo proteins, mediation of apoptosis, hyphal heteroincompatibility, hedgehog signaling, arthropod toxins, cell-cell interaction molecules like teneurins and different signaling messengers.

After at least three long tail fibres have bound, short tail fibres extend and bind irreversibly to the core region of the host cell lipopolysaccharide (LPS), serving as inextensible stays during penetration of the cell envelope by the tail tube. The short tail fibres consist of a parallel, in-register, trimer of gene product 12 (gp12). The 1.9 {\AA} crystal structure of a heat and protease-stable fragment of gp12 reveals three new folds: a central right-handed triple $\beta$-helix, a globular C-terminal domain containing a $\beta$-sandwich and an N-terminal $\beta$-structure reminiscent of but different from the adenovirus triple $\beta$-spiral. The centre of the C-terminal domain shows weak homology to gp11, a trimeric protein connecting the short fibre to the base-plate, suggesting that the trimerisation motifs of gp11 and gp12 are similar. Repeating sequence motifs suggest that the N-terminal $\beta$-structure extends further towards the N terminus and is conserved in the long tail fibre proteins gp34 and gp37.},

This should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences between the formed clusters. The congruence between classifications can be quantified by clustering agreement measures, including pairwise agreement measures. Several measures have been proposed and the importance of obtaining confidence intervals for the point estimate in the comparison of these measures has been highlighted. A broad range of methods can be used for the estimation of confidence intervals. However, evidence is lacking about what are the appropriate methods for the calculation of confidence intervals for most clustering agreement measures. Here we evaluate the resampling techniques of bootstrap and jackknife for the calculation of the confidence intervals for clustering agreement measures. Contrary to what has been shown for some statistics, simulations showed that the jackknife performs better than the bootstrap at accurately estimating confidence intervals for pairwise agreement measures, especially when the agreement between partitions is low. The coverage of the jackknife confidence interval is robust to changes in cluster number and cluster size distribution.},

In Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan is located in the periplasm, where it is protected from exogenous lytic enzymes by the outer membrane. Here we show that the type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches this barrier to deliver two effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, to the periplasm of recipient cells. In this compartment, the effectors hydrolyse peptidoglycan, thereby providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa cells in competition with other bacteria. To protect itself from lysis by Tse1 and Tse3, P. aeruginosa uses specific periplasmically localized immunity proteins. The requirement for these immunity proteins depends on intercellular self-intoxication through an active type VI secretion system, indicating a mechanism for export whereby effectors do not access donor cell periplasm in transit.},

abstract = {An unusual isolate from a human leg wound was identified as Xenorhabdus luminescens. This finding led to the discovery or isolation of four additional strains, two from blood and two from wounds. Three of the five strains were from patients in San Antonio, Tex. Three strains were studied by DNA-DNA hybridization (S1 nuclease-trichloroacetic acid method) and were 77 to 100{\%} related to each other, 34{\%} related to the type strain of X. luminescens, 35 to 40{\%} related to three of Grimont's other DNA hybridization groups of X. luminescens, and 9{\%} related to the type strain of Xenorhabdus nematophilus. The new group of five strains was designated X. luminescens DNA hybridization group 5. All five strains were very inactive biochemically and fermented only D-glucose and D-mannose. The key reactions for recognizing this new organism are yellow pigment production, negative test for nitrate reduction to nitrite, weak bioluminescence (10 to 15 min of dark adaptation is required to see the weak light produced), and a unique hemolytic reaction on sheep blood agar plates incubated at 25 degrees C. Two case histories of strains from wounds are given; these suggest that X. luminescens DNA hybridization group 5 may be a new bacterial agent that causes wound infections. The two cases of wound infection, along with the two blood isolates, suggest that the new organism is clinically significant.},

abstract = {To identify a simplified code for conformational switching, we have redesigned two natural proteins to have 88{\%} sequence identity but different tertiary structures: a 3-alpha helix fold and an alpha/beta fold. We describe the design of these homologous heteromorphic proteins, their structural properties as determined by NMR, their conformational stabilities, and their affinities for their respective ligands: IgG and serum albumin. Each of these proteins is completely folded at 25 degrees C, is monomeric, and retains the native binding activity. The complete binding epitope for both ligands is encoded within each of the proteins. The IgG-binding epitope is functional only in the alpha/beta fold, and the albumin-binding epitope is functional only in the 3-alpha fold. These results demonstrate that two monomeric folds and two different functions can be encoded with only 12{\%} of the amino acids in a protein (7 of 56). The fact that 49 aa in these proteins are compatible with both folds shows that the essential information determining a fold can be highly concentrated in a few amino acids and that a very limited subset of interactions in the protein can tip the balance from one monomer fold to another. This delicate balance helps explain why protein structure prediction is so challenging. Furthermore, because a few mutations can result in both new conformation and new function, the evolution of new folds driven by natural selection for alternative functions may be much more probable than previously recognized.},

abstract = {Curli are functional amyloid fibres that constitute the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in pellicle biofilms formed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (predominantly of the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ classes). They provide a fitness advantage in pathogenic strains and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response during bacteraemia. Curli formation requires a dedicated protein secretion machinery comprising the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG and two soluble accessory proteins, CsgE and CsgF. Here we report the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli CsgG in a non-lipidated, soluble form as well as in its native membrane-extracted conformation. CsgG forms an oligomeric transport complex composed of nine anticodon-binding-domain-like units that give rise to a 36-stranded $\beta$-barrel that traverses the bilayer and is connected to a cage-like vestibule in the periplasm. The transmembrane and periplasmic domains are separated by a 0.9-nm channel constriction composed of three stacked concentric phenylalanine, asparagine and tyrosine rings that may guide the extended polypeptide substrate through the secretion pore. The specificity factor CsgE forms a nonameric adaptor that binds and closes off the periplasmic face of the secretion channel, creating a 24,000 {\AA}(3) pre-constriction chamber. Our structural, functional and electrophysiological analyses imply that CsgG is an ungated, non-selective protein secretion channel that is expected to employ a diffusion-based, entropy-driven transport mechanism.},

abstract = {Type IV secretion (T4S) systems are ancestrally related to bacterial conjugation machines. These systems assemble as a translocation channel, and often also as a surface filament or protein adhesin, at the envelopes of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These organelles mediate the transfer of DNA and protein substrates to phylogenetically diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic target cells. Many basic features of T4S are known, including structures of machine subunits, steps of machine assembly, substrates and substrate recognition mechanisms, and cellular consequences of substrate translocation. A recent advancement also has enabled definition of the translocation route for a DNA substrate through a T4S system of a Gram-negative bacterium. This review emphasizes the dynamics of assembly and function of model conjugation systems and the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/D4 T4S system. We also summarize salient features of the increasingly studied effector translocator systems of mammalian pathogens.},

Using lacZ fusions to genes in the O antigen gene cluster of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, we found that RfaH also regulates the expression of O antigen. We showed that RfaH enhances expression of the 18-kb O antigen gene cluster, with promoter-distal genes affected more dramatically.

This macromolecular machine resembles a stretched, coiled spring (or sheath) wound around a rigid tube with a spike-shaped protein at its tip. A baseplate structure, which is arguably the most complex part of this assembly, relays the contraction signal to the sheath. Here we present the atomic structure of the approximately 6-megadalton bacteriophage T4 baseplate in its pre- and post-host attachment states and explain the events that lead to sheath contraction in atomic detail. We establish the identity and function of a minimal set of components that is conserved in all contractile injection systems and show that the triggering mechanism is universally conserved.},

abstract = {Photorhabdus luminescens is a species of Gram-negative bacteria that is pathogenic to insects while also maintaining a mutualistic association with nematodes from the family Heterorhabditis. P. luminescens elaborates an extensive secondary metabolism during the post-exponential phase of growth that includes the production of an antibiotic called 3-5-dihydroxy-4-isopropylstilbene (ST), an anthraquinone pigment (AQ) and bioluminescence. In this study we identified a mutant that was unable to produce ST, AQ and light. This mutation was found to be in the mdh gene, encoding malate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Interestingly the mdh mutant was unaffected in virulence but was unable to support nematode growth and development in vivo or in vitro. This clearly establishes that secondary metabolism in P. luminescens is required for the mutualistic interaction with the nematode. Furthermore, the construction of mutations in key genes in other central metabolic pathways confirmed the critical role for the TCA cycle in both secondary metabolism and mutualism, but not in virulence. Therefore, we conclude that the TCA cycle is required for the transition of P. luminescens from pathogen to mutualist implicating the involvement of a metabolic switch in the regulation of lifestyle decisions in this bacterium.},

abstract = {The contractile tail of bacteriophage T4 undergoes major structural transitions when the virus attaches to the host cell surface. The baseplate at the distal end of the tail changes from a hexagonal to a star shape. This causes the sheath around the tail tube to contract and the tail tube to protrude from the baseplate and pierce the outer cell membrane and the cell wall before reaching the inner cell membrane for subsequent viral DNA injection. Analogously, the T4 tail can be contracted by treatment with 3 M urea. The structure of the T4 contracted tail, including the head-tail joining region, has been determined by cryo-electron microscopy to 17 {\AA} resolution. This 1200 {\AA}-long, 20 MDa structure has been interpreted in terms of multiple copies of its approximately 20 component proteins. A comparison with the metastable hexagonal baseplate of the mature virus shows that the baseplate proteins move as rigid bodies relative to each other during the structural change.},

abstract = {R-type pyocins are high-molecular-weight bacteriocins carried within the chromosomes of some bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and almost certainly evolved from lysogenic bacteriophages of the Myoviridae family. They contain no head structures and no DNA and are used as defense systems, usually against other strains of the same bacterial species. They bind with their tail fibers to targeted bacterial surface molecules and then kill by inserting a core or needle that dissipates the bacterial membrane potential. Their mechanism of action, high bactericidal potency (one pyocin particle can kill one bacterium), and focused spectrum suggest that R-type pyocins could be developed as antibacterial agents. In a lethal mouse peritonitis model, submicrogram quantities of pyocin prevent death from 90{\%} lethal dose inocula of a pyocin-sensitive, clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa. We show here the dose response curves, treatment windows, or periods of response after infection and the several-log-unit acute reduction of bacterial load in blood and spleen samples, suggesting that R-type pyocins have several characteristics that one would expect from an effective therapeutic.},

Prerequisite for every possible application is the proper surface functionalization of such nanoparticles, which determines their interaction with the environment.

This work aims to review different strategies of surface modification and functionalization of inorganic colloidal nanoparticles with a special focus on the material systems gold and semiconductor nanoparticles, such as CdSe/ZnS.

These datasets, of increasing size, often include examples of multiple different mechanisms of horizontal sequence transfer resulting in substantial alterations to prokaryotic chromosomes. The impact of these processes demands rapid and flexible approaches able to account for recombination when reconstructing isolates' recent diversification. Gubbins is an iterative algorithm that uses spatial scanning statistics to identify loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions suggestive of horizontal sequence transfer while concurrently constructing a maximum likelihood phylogeny based on the putative point mutations outside these regions of high sequence diversity. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistically parameterized models of bacterial evolution, and achieves convergence in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences. Gubbins is appropriate for reconstructing the recent evolutionary history of a variety of haploid genotype alignments, as it makes no assumptions about the underlying mechanism of recombination.

Ancestral genomes from otherwise unrelated phages, including lambda, Mu, P1, P2 and T4, must have exchanged parts of their tail-fibre genes. Individual genes appear as mosaics with parts derived from a common gene pool. Therefore, horizontal gene transfer emerges as a major factor in the evolution of a specific part of phage genomes. Current concepts of homologous recombination cannot account for the formation of such chimeric genes and the recombinational mechanisms responsible are not known. However, recombination sites for DNA invertases and recombination site-like sequences are present at the boundaries of gene segments conferring the specificity for the host receptor. This, together with the properties of the DNA inversion mechanism, suggests that these site-specific recombination enzymes could be responsible for the exchange of host-range determinants.},

abstract = {The studies that correlate the results obtained by different typing methodologies rely solely on qualitative comparisons of the groups defined by each methodology. We propose a framework of measures for the quantitative assessment of correspondences between different typing methods as a first step to the global mapping of type equivalences. A collection of 325 macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates associated with pharyngitis cases in Portugal was used to benchmark the proposed measures. All isolates were characterized by macrolide resistance phenotyping, T serotyping, emm sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), using SmaI or Cfr9I and SfiI. A subset of 41 isolates, representing each PFGE cluster, was also characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The application of Adjusted Rand and Wallace indices allowed the evaluation of the strength and the directionality of the correspondences between the various typing methods and showed that if PFGE or MLST data are available one can confidently predict the emm type (Wallace coefficients of 0.952 for both methods). In contrast, emm typing was a poor predictor of PFGE cluster or MLST sequence type (Wallace coefficients of 0.803 and 0.655, respectively). This was confirmed by the analysis of the larger data set available from http://spyogenes.mlst.net and underscores the necessity of performing PFGE or MLST to unambiguously define clones in S. pyogenes.},

Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from . {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce R-type pyocins, which are high-molecular-weight phage tail-like protein complexes that have bactericidal activity against other Pseudomonas strains. These particles recognize and bind to bacterial surface structures via tail fibers, their primary spectrum determinant. R-type pyocins kill the cell by contracting a sheath-like structure and inserting their hollow core through the cell envelope, resulting in dissipation of the cellular membrane potential. We have retargeted an R-type pyocin to Escherichia coli O157:H7 by fusing a tail spike protein from an O157-specific phage, phiV10, to the pyocin tail fiber. The phiV10 tail spike protein recognizes and degrades the O157 lipopolysaccharide. This engineered pyocin, termed AVR2-V10, is sensitive and specific, killing 100{\%} of diverse E. coli O157:H7 isolates but no other serotypes tested. AVR2-V10 can kill E. coli O157:H7 on beef surfaces, making it a candidate agent for the elimination of this pathogen from food products. All rare AVR2-V10-resistant mutants isolated and examined have lost the ability to produce the O157 antigen and are expected to have compromised virulence. In addition, E. coli O157:H7 exposed to and killed by AVR2-V10 do not release Shiga toxin, as is often the case with many antibiotics, suggesting potential therapeutic applications. The demonstration that a novel R-type pyocin can be created in the laboratory by fusing a catalytic tail spike from the family Podoviridae to a tail fiber of a member of the family Myoviridae is evidence that the plasticity observed among bacteriophage tail genes can, with modern molecular techniques, be exploited to produce nonnatural, targeted antimicrobial agents.},

abstract = {Many icosahedral viruses use a specialized portal vertex to control genome encapsidation and release from the viral capsid. In tailed bacteriophages, the portal system is connected to a tail structure that provides the pipeline for genome delivery to the host cell. We report the first, to our knowledge, subnanometer structures of the complete portal-phage tail interface that mimic the states before and after DNA release during phage infection. They uncover structural rearrangements associated with intimate protein-DNA interactions. The portal protein gp6 of bacteriophage SPP1 undergoes a concerted reorganization of the structural elements of its central channel during interaction with DNA. A network of protein-protein interactions primes consecutive binding of proteins gp15 and gp16 to extend and close the channel. This critical step that prevents genome leakage from the capsid is achieved by a previously unidentified allosteric mechanism: gp16 binding to two different regions of gp15 drives correct positioning and folding of an inner gp16 loop to interact with equivalent loops of the other gp16 subunits. Together, these loops build a plug that closes the channel. Gp16 then fastens the tail to yield the infectious virion. The gatekeeper system opens for viral genome exit at the beginning of infection but recloses afterward, suggesting a molecular diaphragm-like mechanism to control DNA efflux. The mechanisms described here, controlling the essential steps of phage genome movements during virus assembly and infection, are likely to be conserved among long-tailed phages, the largest group of viruses in the Biosphere.},

abstract = {Curli are functional amyloid fibres that constitute the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in pellicle biofilms formed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (predominantly of the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ classes). They provide a fitness advantage in pathogenic strains and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response during bacteraemia. Curli formation requires a dedicated protein secretion machinery comprising the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG and two soluble accessory proteins, CsgE and CsgF. Here we report the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli CsgG in a non-lipidated, soluble form as well as in its native membrane-extracted conformation. CsgG forms an oligomeric transport complex composed of nine anticodon-binding-domain-like units that give rise to a 36-stranded $\beta$-barrel that traverses the bilayer and is connected to a cage-like vestibule in the periplasm. The transmembrane and periplasmic domains are separated by a 0.9-nm channel constriction composed of three stacked concentric phenylalanine, asparagine and tyrosine rings that may guide the extended polypeptide substrate through the secretion pore. The specificity factor CsgE forms a nonameric adaptor that binds and closes off the periplasmic face of the secretion channel, creating a 24,000 {\AA}(3) pre-constriction chamber. Our structural, functional and electrophysiological analyses imply that CsgG is an ungated, non-selective protein secretion channel that is expected to employ a diffusion-based, entropy-driven transport mechanism.},

abstract = {Short tail fibres of T-even like phages are involved in host recognition. To determine the specificity of the fibres, the region containing gene 12 of phages T2, K3, and K3hx was cloned. The genes 11, 12, wac, and 13, coding for the baseplate outer wedge, short tail fibres, collar wishes, and a head completion component, respectively, were localized on the cloned fragments. Plasmid-encoded gene 12 could be expressed without helper phage. Efficient expression of gene 12 from T2 and K3hx made an extraction of protein 12 possible. Hybrid phages obtained by in vitro complementation, recombination analysis and protein 12 binding to host range mutant bacteria excluded a role of the short tail fibres from T2, K3 or K3hx in the recognition of outer membrane proteins. Binding patterns of protein 12 to different Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide mutants and inhibition of binding of protein 12 by a monoclonal antibody against the core region of E. coli K12 lipopolysaccharide suggested that heptose residues are necessary for efficient binding. The binding site of the same monoclonal antibody is different from the short tail fibre binding site in an E. coli B strain suggesting different binding specificities of protein 12. Thus, the ability of different bacterial strains to inactivate phage could be related to differences in the binding specificity of the short tail fibres for the lipopolysaccharides of these bacteria.},

abstract = {Adenovirus invades host cells by first binding to host receptors through a trimeric fiber, which contains three domains: a receptor-binding knob domain, a long flexible shaft domain, and a penton base-attachment tail domain. Although the structure of the knob domain associated with a portion of the shaft has been solved by X-ray crystallography, the in situ structure of the fiber in the virion is not known; thus, it remains a mystery how the trimeric fiber attaches to its underlying pentameric penton base. By high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of the human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) to 3.6-{\AA} resolution and have reported the full atomic models for its capsid proteins, but not for the fiber whose density cannot be directly interpreted due to symmetry mismatch with the penton base. Here, we report the determination of the Ad5 fiber structure and its mode of attachment to the pentameric penton base by using an integrative approach of multi-resolution filtering, homology modeling, computational simulation of mismatched symmetries, and fitting of atomic models into cryo-electron microscopy density maps. Our structure reveals that the interactions between the trimeric fiber and the pentameric penton base are mediated by a hydrophobic ring on the top surface of the penton base and three flexible tails inserted into three of the five available grooves formed by neighboring subunits of penton base. These interaction sites provide the molecular basis for the symmetry mismatch and can be targeted for optimizing adenovirus for gene therapy applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This evidence shows that the second half of the contraction process occurs by a particular displacive mechanism, illustrated in Figure 5; in the first half (which is more difficult to observe), this same displacive mechanism is by far the most likely path of contraction.

abstract = {The enteric gamma-proteobacterium Photorhabdus luminescens kills a wide range of insects, whilst also maintaining a mutualistic relationship with soil nematodes from the family Heterorhabditis. Pathogenicity is associated with bacterial exponential growth, whilst mutualism is associated with post-exponential (stationary) phase. During post-exponential growth, P. luminescens also elaborates an extensive secondary metabolism, including production of bioluminescence, antibiotics and pigment. However, the regulatory network that controls the expression of this secondary metabolism is not well understood. The stringent response is a well-described global regulatory system in bacteria and mediated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp. In this study, we disrupted the genes relA and spoT, encoding the two predicted (p)ppGpp synthases of P. luminescens TTO1, and we showed that (p)ppGpp is required for secondary metabolism. Moreover, we found the (p)ppGpp is not required for pathogenicity of P. luminescens, but is required for bacterial survival within the insect cadaver. Finally, we showed that (p)ppGpp is required for P. luminescens to support normal nematode growth and development. Therefore, the regulatory network that controls the transition from pathogenicity to mutualism in P. luminescens requires (p)ppGpp. This is the first report outlining a role for (p)ppGpp in controlling the outcome of an interaction between a bacteria and its host.

TAdV-3 belongs to the genus Siadenovirus. The carboxy-terminal region of its fibre does not have significant sequence similarity to any other adenovirus fibre heads of known structure. Two amino acid sequence differences between virulent and avirulent TAdV-3 map on the fibre head: where virulent TAdV-3 contains Ile354 and Thr376, avirulent TAdV-3 contains Met354 and Met376. We determined the crystal structures of the trimeric virulent and avirulent TAdV-3 fibre head domains at 2.2 {\AA} resolution. Each monomer contains a beta-sandwich, which, surprisingly, resembles reovirus fibre head more than other adenovirus fibres, although the ABCJ-GHID topology is conserved in all. A beta-hairpin insertion in the C-strand of each trimer subunit embraces its neighbouring monomer. The avirulent and virulent TAdV-3 fibre heads are identical apart from the exact orientation of the beta-hairpin insertion. In vitro, sialyllactose was identified as a ligand by glycan microarray analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and crystallography. Its dissociation constant was measured to be in the mM range by isothermal titration calorimetry. The ligand binds to the side of the fibre head, involving amino acids Glu392, Thr419, Val420, Lys421, Asn422, and Gly423 binding to the sialic acid group. It binds slightly more strongly to the avirulent form. We propose that, in vivo, the TAdV-3 fibre may bind a sialic acid-containing cell surface component.},

We show that spheroplasts secrete Hcp and deliver T6SS substrates into neighbouring cells. Imaging of sheath dynamics shows that the sheath length correlates with the diameter of spheroplasts and may reach up to several micrometres. Analysis of sheath assembly after partial photobleaching shows that subunits are exclusively added to the sheath at the end that is distal from the baseplate and cell envelope attachment. We suggest that this mode of assembly is likely common for all phage-like contractile nanomachines, because of the conservation of the structures and connectivity of sheath subunits.},

These sites are often associated with enzyme inhibition or receptor neutralization, and, at the same time, provide favorable surfaces for crystal packing. Remarkable results have been achieved by using nanobodies with flexible multi-domain proteins, large complexes and, last but not least, membrane proteins.

abstract = {Amino acid repeats (AARs) are abundant in protein sequences. They have particular roles in protein function and evolution. Simple repeat patterns generated by DNA slippage tend to introduce length variations and point mutations in repeat regions. Loss of normal and gain of abnormal function owing to their variable length are potential risks leading to diseases. Repeats with complex patterns mostly refer to the functional domain repeats, such as the well-known leucine-rich repeat and WD repeat, which are frequently involved in protein-protein interaction. They are mainly derived from internal gene duplication events and stabilized by 'gate-keeper' residues, which play crucial roles in preventing inter-domain aggregation. AARs are widely distributed in different proteomes across a variety of taxonomic ranges, and especially abundant in eukaryotic proteins. However, their specific evolutionary and functional scenarios are still poorly understood. Identifying AARs in protein sequences is the first step for the further investigation of their biological function and evolutionary mechanism. In principle, this is an NP-hard problem, as most of the repeat fragments are shaped by a series of sophisticated evolutionary events and become latent periodical patterns. It is not possible to define a uniform criterion for detecting and verifying various repeat patterns. Instead, different algorithms based on different strategies have been developed to cope with different repeat patterns. In this review, we attempt to describe the amino acid repeat-detection algorithms currently available and compare their strategies based on an in-depth analysis of the biological significance of protein repeats.},

abstract = {We recently delineated the importance of a type VI secretion system (T6SS) gene cluster in the virulence of diarrheal isolate SSU of Aeromonas hydrophila and showed that VasH, a sigma(54) activator and T6SS component, was involved in the production of its associated effectors, e.g., hemolysin-coregulated protein. To identify additional T6SS effectors and/or secreted proteins, we subjected culture supernatants from deletion mutants of A. hydrophila, namely, a Delta act mutant (a T2SS-associated cytotoxic enterotoxin-encoding gene) and a Delta act Delta vasH mutant, to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis. Based on these approaches, we identified a member of the VgrG protein family, VgrG1, that contained a vegetative insecticidal protein (VIP-2) domain at its carboxyl-terminal end. Consequently, the vgrG1 gene was cloned in pBI-EGFP and pET-30a vectors to be expressed in HeLa Tet-Off cells and Escherichia coli, respectively. We assessed the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) activity of various domains of purified recombinant VgrG1 (rVgrG1) and provided evidence that only the full-length VgrG1, as well as its carboxyl-terminal domain encoding the VIP-2 domain, showed ADPRT activity. Importantly, bacterium-host cell interaction was needed for the T6SS to induce cytotoxicity in eukaryotic cells, and we demonstrated translocation of VgrG1. Furthermore, our data indicated that expression of the genes encoding the full-length VgrG1 and its carboxyl-terminal domain in HeLa Tet-Off cells disrupted the actin cytoskeleton, which was followed by a decrease in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrated for the first time that VgrG1 of A. hydrophila possessed actin ADPRT activity associated with its VIP-2 domain and that this domain alone was able to induce a rounded phenotype in HeLa Tet-Off cells, followed by apoptosis mediated by caspase 9 activation.},

abstract = {Glycans are among the most complex biological molecules found in nature, being composed of monosaccharide units in various combina-tions and linkages, and featuring diverse and asymmetric types of branching. Until the 1970s, glycan structures were generally repre-sented in scientific publications as chemically accurate drawings, or using standard IUPAC-approved abbreviations (Sharon 1986; McNaught 1997; Chester 1998). However, given the complexity of many glycan structures, it became difficult to represent such molecules in publication figures, especially those involving multistep biosynthet-ic pathways or multiple structures. Thus, various investigators began to use symbols to represent monosaccharides in glycans. In 1978, Kornfeld and colleagues put forward an elegant and simple system for representation of vertebrate glycans (Kornfeld et al. 1978), and it entered into popular use over the next two decades. This system was eventually adopted and standardized by the editors of the first edi-tion of the textbook Essentials of Glycobiology (Varki et al. 1999).},

abstract = {R-type pyocins are high-molecular-weight bacteriocins that resemble bacteriophage tail structures and are produced by some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. R-type pyocins kill by dissipating the bacterial membrane potential after binding. The high-potency, single-hit bactericidal kinetics of R-type pyocins suggest that they could be effective antimicrobials. However, the limited antibacterial spectra of natural R-type pyocins would ultimately compromise their clinical utility. The spectra of these protein complexes are determined in large part by their tail fibers. By replacing the pyocin tail fibers with tail fibers of Pseudomonas phage PS17, we changed the bactericidal specificity of R2 pyocin particles to a different subset of P. aeruginosa strains, including some resistant to PS17 phage. We further extended this idea by fusing parts of R2 tail fibers with parts of tail fibers from phages that infect other bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Yersinia pestis, changing the killing spectrum of pyocins from P. aeruginosa to the bacterial genus, species, or strain that serves as a host for the donor phage. The assembly of active R-type pyocins requires chaperones specific for the C-terminal portion of the tail fiber. Natural and retargeted R-type pyocins exhibit narrow bactericidal spectra and thus can be expected to cause little collateral damage to the healthy microbiotae and not to promote the horizontal spread of multidrug resistance among bacteria. Engineered R-type pyocins may offer a novel alternative to traditional antibiotics in some infections.},

At first glance, autotransporters look to contain all the functional elements required to promote their own secretion: an amino-terminal signal peptide to mediate translocation across the inner membrane, a central passenger domain that is the secreted functional moiety, and a channel-forming carboxyl terminus that facilitates passenger domain translocation across the outer membrane. However, recent discoveries of common structural themes, translocation intermediates and accessory interactions have challenged the perceived simplicity of autotransporter secretion. Here, we discuss how these studies have led to an improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for autotransporter biogenesis.},

abstract = {Precise and fluent genetic manipulation is still limited to only a few prokaryotes. Ideally the highly advanced technologies available in Escherichia coli could be broadly applied. Our efforts to apply lambda Red technology, widely termed 'recombineering', in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus yielded only limited success. Consequently we explored the properties of an endogenous Photorhabdus luminescens lambda Red-like operon, Plu2934/Plu2935/Plu2936. Bioinformatic and functional tests indicate that Plu2936 is a 5'-3' exonuclease equivalent to Red$\alpha$ and Plu2935 is a single strand annealing protein equivalent to Red$\beta$. Plu2934 dramatically enhanced recombineering efficiency. Results from bioinformatic analysis and recombineering assays suggest that Plu2934 may be functionally equivalent to Red$\gamma$, which inhibits the major endogenous E. coli nuclease, RecBCD. The recombineering utility of Plu2934/Plu2935/Plu2936 was demonstrated by engineering Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus genomes, including the activation of the 49-kb non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene cluster plu2670 by insertion of a tetracycline inducible promoter. After tetracycline induction, novel secondary metabolites were identified. Our work unlocks the potential for bioprospecting and functional genomics in the Photorhabdus, Xenorhabdus and related genomes.},

abstract = {The recently identified type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are present in many pathogenic proteobacteria and are encoded by a conserved gene cluster. T6SSs contribute to virulence development of various pathogens and are often activated upon contact with target cells. Since the identification of the T6SS, substantial progress has been made at all levels, including gene regulation, its impact on bacterial virulence, the function of effector proteins and the mechanism of secretion. Recent structural and mechanistic studies revealed unique features of the T6SS that distinguish it from other secretion systems. Structural similarities between the T6SS-specific exoproteins Hcp and VgrG and components of the cell-puncturing device of tailed bacteriophages suggest that the T6SSs mimic a bacteriophage machinery to puncture target cell membranes and to translocate effector proteins, representing a novel mechanism of effector delivery. In bacteriophages contraction of the tail sheath, which engulfs the tail tube, causes ejection of the cell-puncturing machinery. The T6SS components VipA/VipB form tubular structures, which might function as tail sheaths by engulfing Hcp proteins. The severing of VipA/VipB complexes by the AAA+ chaperone ClpV is essential for type VI protein secretion and might be linked to VipA/VipB tubule contraction, leading to the export of Hcp and VgrG.},

abstract = {The term 'quorum sensing' (QS) is generally used to describe the phenomenon that bacteria release and perceive signal molecules to coordinate cooperative behaviour in response to their population size. QS-based communication has therefore been considered a social trait. Here we show that QS signals (N-acyl-homoserine lactones, AHLs) are stochastically produced in young biofilms of Pseudomonas putida and act mainly as self-regulatory signals rather than inducing neighbouring cells. We demonstrate that QS induces the expression of putisolvin biosurfactants that are not public goods, thereby triggering asocial motility of induced cells out of microcolonies. Phenotypic heterogeneity is most prominent in the early stages of biofilm development, whereas at later stages behaviour patterns across cells become more synchronized. Our findings broaden our perspective on QS by showing that AHLs can control the expression of asocial (self-directed) traits, and that heterogeneity in QS can serve as a mechanism to drive phenotypic heterogeneity in self-directed behaviour.},

abstract = {Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium associated with active lesions of chronic periodontitis, produces several proteinases which are presumably involved in host colonization, perturbation of the immune system, and tissue destruction. The aims of this study were to investigate the degradation of human transferrin by gingipain cysteine proteinases of P. gingivalis and to demonstrate the production of toxic hydroxyl radicals (HO*) catalyzed by the iron-containing transferrin fragments generated or by release of iron itself. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting showed that preparations of Arg- and Lys-gingipains of P. gingivalis cleave transferrin (iron-free and iron-saturated forms) into fragments of various sizes. Interestingly, gingival crevicular fluid samples from diseased periodontal sites but not samples from healthy periodontal sites contained fragments of transferrin. By using (55)Fe-transferrin, it was found that degradation by P. gingivalis gingipains resulted in the production of free iron, as well as iron bound to lower-molecular-mass fragments. Subsequent to the degradation of transferrin, bacterial cells assimilated intracellularly the radiolabeled iron. Growth of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, but not growth of an Arg-gingipain- and Lys-gingipain-deficient mutant, was possible in a chemically defined medium containing 30{\%} iron-saturated transferrin as the only source of iron and peptides, suggesting that gingipains play a critical role in the acquisition of essential growth nutrients. Finally, the transferrin degradation products generated by Arg-gingipains A and B were capable of catalyzing the formation of HO*, as determined by a hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system and spin trapping-electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. Our study indicates that P. gingivalis gingipains degrade human transferrin, providing sources of iron and peptides. The iron-containing transferrin fragments or the release of iron itself may contribute to tissue destruction by catalyzing the formation of toxic HO*.},

abstract = {Cellular uptake of nanoparticles for stem cell labeling/tracking is considered as the most promising method. Recently mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are emerging as an idea agent for efficient stem cell labeling. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of surface charge on the highly efficient cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity of MSNs in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The surface charge was varied by the degree of surface modification with N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride and the uptake of MSNs was detected by flow cytometry. 3T3-L1 cells were also used to compare the uptake behavior of MSNs between cell types. A clear correlation of positive surface charge and the number of fluorescence-labeled cells was mainly observed in 3T3-L1 cells. In both cells, uptake of unmodified MSNs was inhibited by phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and cytochalasin D (Cyt D) suggesting a clathrin- and an actin-dependent endocytosis were involved. With strongly positive-charged MSNs, the inhibitory effects were observed in 3T3-L1 cells but not in hMSCs. Without regard to the surface charge, uptake of MSNs into both cells did not affect their viability, proliferation, and differentiation. Our results show that MSNs uptake by hMSCs can be regulated by a threshold of positive surface charge but also imply that the modulation of surface charge on MSNs uptake is specific to cell type. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The lipocalin protein family is a large group of small extracellular proteins. The family demonstrates great diversity at the sequence level; however, most lipocalins share three characteristic conserved sequence motifs, the kernel lipocalins, while a group of more divergent family members, the outlier lipocalins, share only one. Belying this sequence dissimilarity, lipocalin crystal structures are highly conserved and comprise a single eight-stranded continuously hydrogen-bonded antiparallel beta-barrel, which encloses an internal ligand-binding site. Together with two other families of ligand-binding proteins, the fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) and the avidins, the lipocalins form part of an overall structural superfamily: the calycins. Members of the lipocalin family are characterized by several common molecular-recognition properties: the ability to bind a range of small hydrophobic molecules, binding to specific cell-surface receptors and the formation of complexes with soluble macromolecules. The varied biological functions of the lipocalins are mediated by one or more of these properties. In the past, the lipocalins have been classified as transport proteins; however, it is now clear that the lipocalins exhibit great functional diversity, with roles in retinol transport, invertebrate cryptic coloration, olfaction and pheromone transport, and prostaglandin synthesis. The lipocalins have also been implicated in the regulation of cell homoeostasis and the modulation of the immune response, and, as carrier proteins, to act in the general clearance of endogenous and exogenous compounds.},

Due to their stability and the large size, contractile-tailed bacteriophages are traditionally investigated by electron microscopic methods. Complemented by crystallographic studies, a molecular model of contraction for the T4 phage was developed. Lately, also related contractile structures like the Photorhabdus virulence cassette-like particles, the R-Type pyocins and the contractile tubule of the bacterial Type VI secretion system have been analyzed by cryo electron microscopy. Photorhabdus virulence cassette particles and R-Type pyocins are toxin complexes reminiscent of bacteriophage tails that are secreted by bacteria to kill their insect host or competing bacteria. In contrast, the Type VI secretion system is an intracellular apparatus for injection of effector proteins into bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Although it shares homology with other contractile systems, the Type VI secretion system is additionally equipped with a recycling function, which makes it suitable for multiple rounds of action. Starting from the 3D reconstructions, we compare these molecular machines structurally and functionally to their viral counterparts and summarize the current knowledge on their respective mode of action.},

abstract = {The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a large multicomponent, dynamic macromolecular machine that has an important role in the ecology of many Gram-negative bacteria. T6SS is responsible for translocation of a wide range of toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells. The T6SS organelle is functionally analogous to contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the VgrG spike. Neither the exact protein composition of the T6SS organelle nor the mechanisms of effector selection and delivery are known. Here we report that proteins from the PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical extension on the VgrG spike, which is further involved in attaching effector domains to the spike. The crystal structures of two PAAR-repeat proteins bound to VgrG-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the T6SS spike complex. We demonstrate that PAAR proteins are essential for T6SS-mediated secretion and target cell killing by Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi. Our results indicate a new model of the T6SS organelle in which the VgrG-PAAR spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation event.},

abstract = {The computational reconstruction of ancestral proteins provides information on past biological events and has practical implications for biomedicine and biotechnology. Currently available tools for ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) are often based on empirical amino acid substitution models that assume that all sites evolve at the same rate and under the same process. However, this assumption is frequently violated because protein evolution is highly heterogeneous due to different selective constraints among sites. Here, we present ProtASR, a new evolutionary framework to infer ancestral protein sequences accounting for selection on protein stability. First, ProtASR generates site-specific substitution matrices through the structurally constrained mean-field substitution model (MF), which considers both unfolding and misfolding stability. We previously showed that MF models outperform empirical amino acid substitution models, as well as other structurally constrained substitution models, both in terms of likelihood and correctly inferring amino acid distributions across sites. In the second step, ProtASR adapts a well-established maximum-likelihood (ML) ASR procedure to infer ancestral proteins under MF models. A known bias of ML ASR methods is that they tend to overestimate the stability of ancestral proteins by under-estimating the frequency of deleterious mutations. We compared ProtASR under MF to two empirical substitution models (JTT and CAT), reconstructing the ancestral sequences of simulated proteins. ProtASR yields reconstructed proteins with less biased stabilities, which are significantly closer to those of the simulated proteins. Analysis of extant protein families suggests that folding stability evolves through time across protein families, potentially reflecting neutral fluctuation. Some families exhibit a more constant protein folding stability, while others are more variable. ProtASR is freely available from https://github.com/miguelarenas/protasr and includes detailed documentation and ready-to-use examples. It runs in seconds/minutes depending on protein length and alignment size.},

abstract = {The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile machine that delivers toxins into either eukaryotic or bacterial cells. At a molecular level, the T6SS is composed of a membrane complex that anchors a long cytoplasmic tubular structure to the cell envelope. This structure is thought to resemble the tail of contractile bacteriophages. It is composed of the Hcp protein that assembles into hexameric rings stacked onto each other to form a tube similar to the phage tail tube. This tube is proposed to be wrapped by a structure called the sheath, composed of two proteins, TssB and TssC. It has been shown using fluorescence microscopy that the TssB and TssC proteins assemble into a tubular structure that cycles between long and short conformations suggesting that, similarly to the bacteriophage sheath, the T6SS sheath undergoes elongation and contraction events. The TssB and TssC proteins have been shown to interact and a specific $\alpha$-helix of TssB is required for this interaction. Here, we confirm that the TssB and TssC proteins interact in enteroaggregative E. coli. We further show that this interaction requires the N-terminal region of TssC and the conserved $\alpha$-helix of TssB. Using site-directed mutagenesis coupled to phenotypic analyses, we demonstrate that an hydrophobic motif located in the N-terminal region of this helix is required for interaction with TssC, sheath assembly and T6SS function.},

While the long fiber binds to the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor, the function of the short fiber in the virus life cycle is poorly understood. Here, we show, by glycan microarray analysis and cellular studies, that the short fiber knob (SFK) of HAdV-52 recognizes long chains of $\alpha$-2,8-linked polysialic acid (polySia), a large posttranslational modification of selected carrier proteins, and that HAdV-52 can use polySia as a receptor on target cells. X-ray crystallography, NMR, molecular dynamics simulation, and structure-guided mutagenesis of the SFK reveal that the nonreducing, terminal sialic acid of polySia engages the protein with direct contacts, and that specificity for polySia is achieved through subtle, transient electrostatic interactions with additional sialic acid residues. In this study, we present a previously unrecognized role for polySia as a cellular receptor for a human viral pathogen. Our detailed analysis of the determinants of specificity for this interaction has general implications for protein–carbohydrate interactions, particularly concerning highly charged glycan structures, and provides interesting dimensions on the biology and evolution of members of Human mastadenovirus G.},

Whereas most other adenoviruses infect cells by engaging CD46 or the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), Ad37 binds previously unknown sialic acid-containing cell surface molecules. By glycan array screening, we show here that the receptor-recognizing knob domain of the Ad37 fiber protein specifically binds a branched hexasaccharide that is present in the GD1a ganglioside and that features two terminal sialic acids. Soluble GD1a glycan and GD1a-binding antibodies efficiently prevented Ad37 virions from binding and infecting corneal cells. Unexpectedly, the receptor is constituted by one or more glycoproteins containing the GD1a glycan motif rather than the ganglioside itself, as shown by binding, infection and flow cytometry experiments. Molecular modeling, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography reveal that the two terminal sialic acids dock into two of three previously established sialic acid-binding sites in the trimeric Ad37 knob. Surface plasmon resonance analysis shows that the knob-GD1a glycan interaction has high affinity. Our findings therefore form a basis for the design and development of sialic acid-containing antiviral drugs for topical treatment of EKC.},

abstract = {An intracellular multiplication F (IcmF) family protein is a conserved component of a newly identified type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded in many animal and plant-associated Proteobacteria. We have previously identified ImpL(M), an IcmF family protein that is required for the secretion of the T6SS substrate hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) from the plant-pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In this study, we characterized the topology of ImpL(M) and the importance of its nucleotide-binding Walker A motif involved in Hcp secretion from A. tumefaciens. A combination of beta-lactamase-green fluorescent protein fusion and biochemical fractionation analyses revealed that ImpL(M) is an integral polytopic inner membrane protein comprising three transmembrane domains bordered by an N-terminal domain facing the cytoplasm and a C-terminal domain exposed to the periplasm. impL(M) mutants with substitutions or deletions in the Walker A motif failed to complement the impL(M) deletion mutant for Hcp secretion, which provided evidence that ImpL(M) may bind and/or hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates to mediate T6SS machine assembly and/or substrate secretion. Protein-protein interaction and protein stability analyses indicated that there is a physical interaction between ImpL(M) and another essential T6SS component, ImpK(L). Topology and biochemical fractionation analyses suggested that ImpK(L) is an integral bitopic inner membrane protein with an N-terminal domain facing the cytoplasm and a C-terminal OmpA-like domain exposed to the periplasm. Further comprehensive yeast two-hybrid assays dissecting ImpL(M)-ImpK(L) interaction domains suggested that ImpL(M) interacts with ImpK(L) via the N-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the proteins. In conclusion, ImpL(M) interacts with ImpK(L), and its Walker A motif is required for its function in mediation of Hcp secretion from A. tumefaciens.},

abstract = {The type VI secretion system (T6SS) of bacteria plays a key role in competing for specific niches by the contact-dependent killing of competitors. Recently, Rhs proteins with polymorphic C-terminal toxin-domains that inhibit or kill neighboring cells were identified. In this report, we identified a novel Rhs with an MPTase4 (Metallopeptidase-4) domain (designated as Rhs-CT1) that showed an antibacterial effect via T6SS in Escherichia coli. We managed to develop a specific strategy by matching the diagnostic domain-architecture of Rhs-CT1 (Rhs with an N-terminal PAAR-motif and a C-terminal toxin domain) for effector retrieval and discovered a series of Rhs-CTs in E. coli. Indeed, the screened Rhs-CT3 with a REase-3 (Restriction endonuclease-3) domain also mediated interbacterial antagonism. Further analysis revealed that vgrGO1 and eagR/DUF1795 (upstream of rhs-ct) were required for the delivery of Rhs-CTs, suggesting eagR as a potential T6SS chaperone. In addition to chaperoned Rhs-CTs, neighborless Rhs-CTs could be classified into a distinct family (Rhs-Nb) sharing close evolutionary relationship with T6SS2-Rhs (encoded in the T6SS2 cluster of E. coli). Notably, the Rhs-Nb-CT5 was confirmed bioinformatically and experimentally to mediate interbacterial antagonism via Hcp2B-VgrG2 module. In a further retrieval analysis, we discovered various toxin/immunity pairs in extensive bacterial species that could be systematically classified into eight referential clans, suggesting that Rhs-CTs greatly diversify the antibacterial pathways of T6SS.},

T6SS delivers effectors to neighboring cells and corresponding antagonistic proteins confer immunity against effectors that are delivered by sister cells. Although T6SS has been found in more than 100 gram-negative bacteria including many important human pathogens, few T6SS-dependent effector and immunity proteins have been experimentally determined. Here we report a high-throughput approach using transposon mutagenesis and deep sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify T6SS immunity proteins in Vibrio cholerae. Saturating transposon mutagenesis was performed in wild type and a T6SS null mutant. Genes encoding immunity proteins were predicted to be essential in the wild type but dispensable in the T6SS mutant. By comparing the relative abundance of each transposon mutant in the mutant library using deep sequencing, we identified three immunity proteins that render protection against killing by T6SS predatory cells. We also identified their three cognate T6SS-secreted effectors and show these are important for not only antibacterial and antieukaryotic activities but also assembly of T6SS apparatus. The lipase and muramidase T6SS effectors identified in this study underscore the diversity of T6SS-secreted substrates and the distinctly different mechanisms that target these for secretion by the dynamic T6SS organelle.},

abstract = {Pathogenic microorganisms have to face hostile environments while colonizing and infecting their hosts. Unfortunately, they can cope with it and have evolved a number of complex secretion systems, which direct virulence factors either at the bacterial cell surface into the environmental extracellular milieu or into the host cell cytosol. Six different classes of secretion systems have been described so far, currently identified as type I secretion system (T1SS) up to type VI secretion system (T6SS). The Gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses a broad panel of secretion systems. Five of the six secretion machines characterized in Gram-negative bacteria are at P. aeruginosa disposal, sometimes in several copies. All these machines are dedicated to the specific secretion of exoproteins, which display various activities useful for bacterial adaptation to the environment or for bacterial pathogenicity. This review will summarize the functional organization of these different secretion systems, which could constitute potential targets for therapeutic treatment of patients infected by one of the most potent nosocomial pathogens identified nowadays. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Protozoa play host for many intracellular bacteria and are important for the adaptation of pathogenic bacteria to eukaryotic cells. We analyzed the genome sequence of "Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus," an obligate intracellular amoeba symbiont belonging to the Bacteroidetes. The genome has a size of 1.89 Mbp, encodes 1,557 proteins, and shows massive proliferation of IS elements (24{\%} of all genes), although the genome seems to be evolutionarily relatively stable. The genome does not encode pathways for de novo biosynthesis of cofactors, nucleotides, and almost all amino acids. "Ca. Amoebophilus asiaticus" encodes a variety of proteins with predicted importance for host cell interaction; in particular, an arsenal of proteins with eukaryotic domains, including ankyrin-, TPR/SEL1-, and leucine-rich repeats, which is hitherto unmatched among prokaryotes, is remarkable. Unexpectedly, 26 proteins that can interfere with the host ubiquitin system were identified in the genome. These proteins include F- and U-box domain proteins and two ubiquitin-specific proteases of the CA clan C19 family, representing the first prokaryotic members of this protein family. Consequently, interference with the host ubiquitin system is an important host cell interaction mechanism of "Ca. Amoebophilus asiaticus". More generally, we show that the eukaryotic domains identified in "Ca. Amoebophilus asiaticus" are also significantly enriched in the genomes of other amoeba-associated bacteria (including chlamydiae, Legionella pneumophila, Rickettsia bellii, Francisella tularensis, and Mycobacterium avium). This indicates that phylogenetically and ecologically diverse bacteria which thrive inside amoebae exploit common mechanisms for interaction with their hosts, and it provides further evidence for the role of amoebae as training grounds for bacterial pathogens of humans.},

Here, the structure of the VipA/B sheath was exploited to generate immunogenic multivalent particles for vaccine delivery. Sheaths composed of VipB and VipA fused to an antigen of interest were purified from Vibrio cholerae or Escherichia coli and used for immunization. Sheaths displaying heterologous antigens generated better immune responses against the antigen and different IgG subclasses compared with soluble antigen alone. Moreover, antigen-specific antibodies raised against sheaths presenting Neisseria meningitidis factor H binding protein (fHbp) antigen were functional in a serum bactericidal assay. Our results demonstrate that multivalent nanoparticles based on the T6SS sheath represent a versatile scaffold for vaccine applications.},

To see whether the features that define the molecular recognition of sialic acid were found in other sialic-acid-binding proteins, we analyzed 127 structures with bound sialic acids found in the Protein Data Bank database. Of these, the canine adenovirus 2-fiber knob protein showed close local structural relationship to Siglecs despite low sequence similarity. The fiber knob harbors a noncanonical sialic-acid recognition site, which was then explored for detailed specificity using a custom glycan microarray comprising 58 diverse sialosides. It was found that the adenoviral protein preferentially recognizes the epitope Neu5Ac$\alpha$2-3[6S]Gal$\beta$1-4GlcNAc, a structure previously identified as the preferred ligand for Siglec-8 in humans and Siglec-F in mice. Comparison of the Siglec and fiber knob sialic-acid-binding sites reveal conserved structural elements that are not clearly identifiable from the primary amino acid sequence, suggesting a Siglec-like sialic-acid-binding motif that comprises the consensus features of these proteins in complex with sialic acid.},

Experiments with truncated FliC fragments demonstrated that the C-terminal disordered region of flagellin is essential for FliS binding.

Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Gamma yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets {\textgreater} or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively.

abstract = {The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is widespread among bacterial pathogens and acts as an effective weapon against competitor bacteria and eukaryotic hosts by delivering toxic effector proteins directly into target cells. The T6SS utilises a bacteriophage-like contractile machinery to expel a puncturing device based on a tube of Hcp topped with a VgrG spike, which can be extended by a final tip from a PAAR domain-containing protein. Effector proteins are believed to be delivered by specifically associating with particular Hcp, VgrG or PAAR proteins, either covalently ('specialised') or non-covalently ('cargo' effectors). Here we used the T6SS of the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens, together with integratecd genetic, proteomic and biochemical approaches, to elucidate the role of specific VgrG and PAAR homologues in T6SS function and effector specificity, revealing new aspects and unexpected subtleties in effector delivery by the T6SS. We identified effectors, both cargo and specialised, absolutely dependent on a particular VgrG for delivery to target cells, and discovered that other cargo effectors can show a preference for a particular VgrG. The presence of at least one PAAR protein was found to be essential for T6SS function, consistent with designation as a 'core' T6SS component. We showed that specific VgrG-PAAR combinations are required to assemble a functional T6SS and that the three distinct VgrG-PAAR assemblies in S. marcescens exhibit distinct effector specificity and efficiency. Unexpectedly, we discovered that two different PAAR-containing Rhs proteins can functionally pair with the same VgrG protein. Showing that accessory EagR proteins are involved in these interactions, native VgrG-Rhs-EagR complexes were isolated and specific interactions between EagR and cognate Rhs proteins identified. This study defines an essential yet flexible role for PAAR proteins in the T6SS and highlights the existence of distinct versions of the machinery with differential effector specificity and efficiency of target cell delivery.},

abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made during the past ten years in elucidating the structure of the bacteriophage T4 tail by a combination of three-dimensional image reconstruction from electron micrographs and X-ray crystallography of the components. Partial and complete structures of nine out of twenty tail structural proteins have been determined by X-ray crystallography and have been fitted into the 3D-reconstituted structure of the "extended" tail. The 3D structure of the "contracted" tail was also determined and interpreted in terms of component proteins. Given the pseudo-atomic tail structures both before and after contraction, it is now possible to understand the gross conformational change of the baseplate in terms of the change in the relative positions of the subunit proteins. These studies have explained how the conformational change of the baseplate and contraction of the tail are related to the tail's host cell recognition and membrane penetration function. On the other hand, the baseplate assembly process has been recently reexamined in detail in a precise system involving recombinant proteins (unlike the earlier studies with phage mutants). These experiments showed that the sequential association of the subunits of the baseplate wedge is based on the induced-fit upon association of each subunit. It was also found that, upon association of gp53 (gene product 53), the penultimate subunit of the wedge, six of the wedge intermediates spontaneously associate to form a baseplate-like structure in the absence of the central hub. Structure determination of the rest of the subunits and intermediate complexes and the assembly of the hub still require further study.},

abstract = {Often, biological sequence analysis is just a matter of putting the right label on each residue. In gene identification, we want to label nucleotides as exons, introns, or inter-genic sequence. In sequence alignment, we want to associate residues in a query sequence with homologous residues in a tar-get database sequence. We can always write an ad hoc program for any given problem, but the same frustrating issues will always recur. One is that we want to incorporate heterogeneous sources of information. A genefinder, for instance, ought to combine splice-site consensus, codon bias, exon/ intron length preferences and open reading frame analysis into one scoring system. How should these parameters be set? How should different kinds of information be weighted? A second issue is to interpret results proba-bilistically. Finding a best scoring answer is one thing, but what does the score mean, and how confident are we that the best scor-ing answer is correct? A third issue is exten-sibility. The moment we perfect our ad hoc genefinder, we wish we had also modeled translational initiation consensus, alterna-tive splicing and a polyadenylation signal. Too often, piling more reality onto a fragile ad hoc program makes it collapse under its own weight. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a formal foundation for making probabilistic models of linear sequence 'labeling' prob-lems 1,2 . They provide a conceptual toolkit for building complex models just by draw-ing an intuitive picture. They are at the heart of a diverse range of programs, including genefinding, profile searches, multiple sequence alignment and regulatory site identification. HMMs are the Legos of com-putational sequence analysis. A toy HMM: 5′ splice site recognition As a simple example, imagine the following caricature of a 5′ splice-site recognition problem. Assume we are given a DNA sequence that begins in an exon, contains one 5′ splice site and ends in an intron. The problem is to identify where the switch from exon to intron occurred—where the 5′ splice site (5′SS) is. For us to guess intelligently, the sequences of exons, splice sites and introns must have different statistical properties. Let's imagine some simple differences: say that exons have a uniform base composition on average (25{\%} each base), introns are A/T rich (say, 40{\%} each for A/T, 10{\%} each for C/G), and the 5′SS consensus nucleotide is almost always a G (say, 95{\%} G and 5{\%} A). Starting from this information, we can draw an HMM (Fig. 1). The HMM invokes three states, one for each of the three labels we might assign to a nucleotide: E (exon), 5 (5′SS) and I (intron). Each state has its own emission probabilities (shown above the states), which model the base composition of exons, introns and the consensus G at the 5′SS. Each state also has transition probabili-ties (arrows), the probabilities of moving from this state to a new state. The transition},

abstract = {A valuable resource available in the search for new natural products is the diverse microbial life that spans the planet. A large subset of these microorganisms synthesize complex specialized metabolites exhibiting biomedically important activities. A limiting step to the characterization of these compounds is an elucidation of the genetic regulatory mechanisms that oversee their production. Although proteins that control transcription initiation of specialized metabolite gene clusters have been identified, those affecting transcription elongation have not been broadly investigated. In this study, we analysed the phylogenetic distribution of the large, widespread NusG family of transcription elongation proteins and found that it includes a cohesive outgroup of paralogues (herein coined LoaP), which are often positioned adjacent or within gene clusters for specialized metabolites. We established Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LoaP as a paradigm for this protein subgroup and showed that it regulated the transcriptional readthrough of termination sites located within two different antibiotic biosynthesis operons. Both of these antibiotics have been implicated in plant-protective activities, demonstrating that LoaP controls an important regulon of specialized metabolite genes for this microorganism. These data therefore reveal transcription elongation as a point of regulatory control for specialized metabolite pathways and introduce a subgroup of NusG proteins for this purpose.},

abstract = {To the Editor Assignment of structure and function to all genes and gene products (such as proteins) of all organisms represents a major challenge in this postgenomic era. Here we present the I-TASSER Suite (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/download/), a stand-alone software package for protein structure and function modeling. The gap between the number of proteins with known sequences and the number of proteins with experimentally characterized structure and function keeps increasing. One way to narrow this gap is by developing advanced computational approaches for modeling structure and function from sequences, where progress has been recently witnessed in community-wide blind experiments 1,2 . I-TASSER 3 was originally designed for protein structure modeling by iterative threading assembly simulations. It was recently extended for structure-based function annotation by matching structure predictions with known functional templates 4,5 . Here we introduce the I-TASSER Suite, a stand-alone package implementing the I-TASSER–based protein structure and function modeling pipelines. Although the on-line I-TASSER server is established and widely used in the community, limited computing resources from a single laboratory have prevented large-scale applications of these algorithms. We expect that the development of the stand-alone package will remove the computing resource barriers and therefore enable benchmarking of new structure and function modeling methods. The I-TASSER Suite pipeline consists of four general steps: threading template identification, iterative structure assembly simulation, model selection and refinement, and structure-based function annotation (Fig. 1a). In the first step, the query is threaded by},

We show that an unusual response regulator, PleD, is required for polar differentiation and is sequestered to the cell pole only when it is activated by phosphorylation. Dynamic localization of PleD to the cell pole provides a mechanism to temporally and spatially control the signaling output of PleD during development. Targeting of PleD to the cell pole is coupled to the activation of a C-terminal guanylate cyclase domain, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate. We propose that the local action of this novel-type guanylate cyclase might constitute a general regulatory principle in bacterial growth and development.},

The pioneering work in the early 1970s, using DNA ligases to paste DNA into episomal vectors, is still the most widely used approach. Here we describe a different principle, using ET recombination, for directed cloning and subcloning, which offers a variety of advantages. Most prominently, a chosen DNA region can be cloned from a complex mixture without prior isolation. Hence cloning by ET recombination resembles PCR in that both involve the amplification of a DNA region between two chosen points. We apply the strategy to subclone chosen DNA regions from several target molecules resident in E. coli hosts, and to clone chosen DNA regions from genomic DNA preparations. Here we analyze basic aspects of the approach and present several examples that illustrate its simplicity, flexibility, and remarkable efficiency.},

abstract = {Photorhabdus spp., the only known bioluminescent terrestrial bacteria are well known for their symbiotic association with heterorhabditid nematodes. This association, along with their ability to kill insects, has aroused interest in the evolutionary relationships within this bacterial group. Currently, three species are recognized within the genus Photorhabdus; P. temperata and P. luminescens, which are endosymbionts of Heterorhabditis spp., and P. asymbiotica, which has been isolated from human wounds and has recently been shown to also have a heterorhabditid nematode vector. To examine phylogenetic relationships among these taxa, we utilize total evidence Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony based analyses of three genetic loci (16S rRNA gene, gyrB, and glnA) to construct a robust evolutionary hypothesis for the genus Photorhabdus. Here we use this phylogeny to evaluate existing specific and sub-specific taxonomic statements within the genus, identify previously undescribed Photorhabdus strains, test the utility of 16S rRNA gene, gyrB, and glnA in resolving various levels of relationships within the genus, and, finally, to investigate the evolution of bioluminescence. The genes examined produced the most robust phylogenetic hypothesis to date for the genus Photorhabdus, as indicated by strong bootstrap and posterior probability values at previously unresolved or poorly resolved nodes. We show that glnA is particularly useful in resolving specific and intra-specific relationships poorly resolved in other studies. We conclude that P. asymbiotica is the sister group to P. luminescens and that the new strains HIT and JUN should be given a new group designation within P. asymbiotica. Furthermore, we reveal a pattern of decline in bioluminescent intensity through the evolution of Photorhabdus, suggesting that this may be a trait acquired and maintained under previous ecological (aquatic) selection pressures that is now gradually being lost in its terrestrial environment.},

abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity in microbial communities enables genetically identical organisms to behave differently even under the same environmental conditions. Photorhabdus luminescens, a bioluminescent Gram-negative bacterium, contains a complex life cycle, which involves a symbiotic interaction with nematodes as well as a pathogenic association with insect larvae. P. luminescens exists in two distinct phenotypic cell types, designated as the primary (1°) and secondary (2°) cells. The 1° cells are bioluminescent, pigmented and can support nematode growth and development. Individual 1° cells undergo phenotypic switching after prolonged cultivation and convert to 2° cells, which lack the 1° specific phenotypes. The LysR-type regulator HexA has been described as major regulator of this switching process. Here we show that HexA controls phenotypic heterogeneity in a versatile way, directly and indirectly. Expression of hexA is enhanced in 2° cells, and the corresponding regulator inhibits 1° specific traits in 2° cells. HexA does not directly affect bioluminescence, a predominant 1° specific phenotype. Since the respective luxCDABE operon is repressed at the post-transcriptional level and transcriptional levels of the RNA chaperone gene hfq are also enhanced in 2° cells, small regulatory RNAs are presumably involved that are under control of HexA. Another phenotypic trait that is specific for 1° cells is quorum sensing mediated cell clumping. The corresponding pcfABCDEF operon could be identified as the first direct target of HexA, since the regulator binds to the pcfA promoter region and thereby blocks expression of the target operon. In summary, our data show that HexA fulfills the task as repressor of 1° specific features in 2° cells in a versatile way and gives first insights into the complexity of regulating phenotypic heterogeneity in Photorhabdus bacteria.},

abstract = {Protein structures change during evolution in response to mutations. Here, we analyze the mapping between sequence and structure in a set of structurally aligned protein domains. To avoid artifacts, we restricted our attention only to the core components of these structures. We found that on average, using different measures of structural change, protein cores evolve linearly with evolutionary distance (amino acid substitutions per site). This is true irrespective of which measure of structural change we used, whether RMSD or discrete structural descriptors for secondary structure, accessibility, or contacts. This linear response allows us to quantify the claim that structure is more conserved than sequence. Using structural alphabets of similar cardinality to the sequence alphabet, structural cores evolve three to ten times slower than sequences. Although we observed an average linear response, we found a wide variance. Different domain families varied fivefold in structural response to evolution. An attempt to categorically analyze this variance among subgroups by structural and functional category revealed only one statistically significant trend. This trend can be explained by the fact that beta-sheets change faster than alpha-helices, most likely due to that they are shorter and that change occurs at the ends of the secondary structure elements. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli K-12 and B have been the subjects of classical experiments from which much of our understanding of molecular genetics has emerged. We present here complete genome sequences of two E. coli B strains, REL606, used in a long-term evolution experiment, and BL21(DE3), widely used to express recombinant proteins. The two genomes differ in length by 72,304 bp and have 426 single base pair differences, a seemingly large difference for laboratory strains having a common ancestor within the last 67 years. Transpositions by IS1 and IS150 have occurred in both lineages. Integration of the DE3 prophage in BL21(DE3) apparently displaced a defective prophage in the $\lambda$ attachment site of B. As might have been anticipated from the many genetic and biochemical experiments comparing B and K-12 over the years, the B genomes are similar in size and organization to the genome of E. coli K-12 MG1655 and have {\textgreater} 99{\%} sequence identity over ∼ 92{\%} of their genomes. E. coli B and K-12 differ considerably in distribution of IS elements and in location and composition of larger mobile elements. An unexpected difference is the absence of a large cluster of flagella genes in B, due to a 41 kbp IS1-mediated deletion. Gene clusters that specify the LPS core, O antigen, and restriction enzymes differ substantially, presumably because of horizontal transfer. Comparative analysis of 32 independently isolated E. coli and Shigella genomes, both commensals and pathogenic strains, identifies a minimal set of genes in common plus many strain-specific genes that constitute a large E. coli pan-genome. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The abundant existence of proteins and regions that possess specific functions without being uniquely folded into unique 3D structures has become accepted by a significant number of protein scientists. Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases. Gaining structural and functional information about these proteins is a challenge, since they do not typically "freeze" while their "pictures are taken." However, despite or perhaps because of the experimental challenges, these fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting targets for modern protein research. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent advances in this exciting field and considers some of the basic lessons learned from the analysis of physics, chemistry, and biology of IDPs.},

abstract = {The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile machine that delivers toxins into either eukaryotic or bacterial cells. It thus represents a key player in bacterial pathogenesis and inter-bacterial competition. Schematically, the T6SS can be viewed as a contractile tail structure anchored to the cell envelope. The contraction of the tail sheath propels the inner tube loaded with effectors towards the target cell. The components of the contracted tail sheath are then recycled by the ClpV AAA(+) ATPase for a new cycle of tail elongation. The T6SS is widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and most of their genomes carry several copies of T6SS gene clusters, which might be activated in different conditions. Here, we show that the ClpV ATPases encoded within the two T6SS gene clusters of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli are not interchangeable and specifically participate to the activity of their cognate T6SS. Here we show that this specificity is dictated by interaction between the ClpV N-terminal domains and the N-terminal helices of their cognate TssC1 proteins. We also present the crystal structure of the ClpV1 N-terminal domain, alone or in complex with the TssC1 N-terminal peptide, highlighting the commonalities and diversities in the recruitment of ClpV to contracted sheaths.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria use the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) to inject toxic proteins into rival bacteria or eukaryotic cells. However, the mechanism of the T6SS is incompletely understood. In the present study, we investigated a conserved component of the T6SS, TssK, using the antibacterial T6SS of Serratia marcescens as a model system. TssK was confirmed to be essential for effector secretion by the T6SS. The native protein, although not an integral membrane protein, appeared to localize to the inner membrane, consistent with its presence within a membrane-anchored assembly. Recombinant TssK purified from S. marcescens was found to exist in several stable oligomeric forms, namely trimer, hexamer and higher-order species. Native-level purification of TssK identified TssF and TssG as interacting proteins. TssF and TssG, conserved T6SS components of unknown function, were required for T6SS activity, but not for correct localization of TssK. A complex containing TssK, TssF and TssG was subsequently purified in vitro, confirming that these three proteins form a new subcomplex within the T6SS. Our findings provide new insight into the T6SS assembly, allowing us to propose a model whereby TssK recruits TssFG into the membrane-associated T6SS complex and different oligomeric states of TssK may contribute to the dynamic mechanism of the system.},

abstract = {Type III secretion systems of Gram-negative bacteria are specific export machineries for virulence factors which allow their translocation to eukaryotic cells. Since they correlate with bacterial pathogenicity, their presence is used as a general indicator of bacterial virulence. By comparing the genetic relationship of the major type III secretion systems we found the family of genes encoding the inner-membrane channel proteins represented by the Yersinia enterocolitica lcrD (synonym yscV) and its homologous genes from other species an ideal component for establishing a general detection approach for type III secretion systems. Based on the genes of the lcrD family we developed gene probes for Gram-negative human, animal and plant pathogens. The probes comprise lcrD from Y. enterocolitica, sepA from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, invA from Salmonella typhimurium, mxiA from Shigella sonnei, as well as hrcV from Erwinia amylovora. In addition we included as a control probe the flhA gene from E. coli K-12 to validate our approach. FlhA is part of the flagellar export apparatus which shows a high degree of similarity with type III secretions systems, but is not involved in pathogenicity. The probes were evaluated by screening a series of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. The probes detected type III secretion in pathogens where such systems were either known or were expected to be present, whereas no positive hybridization signals could be found in non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were devoid of known type III secretion systems. No interference due to the genetic similarity between the type III secretion system and the flagellar export apparatus was observed. However, potential type III secretion systems could be detected in bacteria where no such systems have been described yet. The presented approach provides therefore a useful tool for the assessment of the virulence potential of bacterial isolates of human, animal and plant origin. Moreover, it is a powerful means for a first safety assessment of poorly characterized strains intended to be used in biotechnological applications. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

When the hly operon was placed under the control of the inducible tac promoter, expression remained dependent upon this element, when transcribed in its native orientation 3' of the promoter. The increase in ptac-directed transcription was strongest for the distal, export genes of the hly operon, and was particularly striking when ptac and the element were placed far upstream. The element did not influence transcript stability, and we suggest that it is a key component of a novel regulatory mechanism may suppresses transcription polarity within operons. The mechanism that be of widespread importance in bacterial gene expression because the 8 bp element is present in many Gram-negative species as an upstream component of operons encoding the production of toxins and the surface assembly of polysaccharides and components required for the conjugal transfer of DNA.

abstract = {Bacteriophage-based medical research provides the opportunity to develop targeted nanomedicines with heightened efficiency and safety profiles. Filamentous phages also can and have been formulated as targeted drug-delivery nanomedicines, and phage may also serve as promising alternatives/complements to antibiotics. Over the past decade the use of phage for both the prophylaxis and the treatment of bacterial infection, has gained special significance in view of a dramatic rise in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance bacterial strains. Two potential medical applications of phages are the treatment of bacterial infections and their use as immunizing agents in diagnosis and monitoring patients with immunodeficiencies. Recently, phages have been employed as gene-delivery vectors (phage nanomedicine), for nearly half a century as tools in genetic research, for about two decades as tools for the discovery of specific target-binding proteins and peptides, and for almost a decade as tools for vaccine development. As phage applications to human therapeutic development grow at an exponential rate, it will become essential to evaluate host immune responses to initial and repetitive challenges by therapeutic phage in order to develop phage therapies that offer suitable utility. This paper examines and discusses phage nanomedicine applications and the immunomodulatory effects of bacteriophage exposure and treatment modalities.

abstract = {The quest for the discovery of novel natural products has entered a new chapter with the enormous wealth of genetic data that is now available. This information has been exploited by using whole-genome sequence mining to uncover cryptic pathways, or biosynthetic pathways for previously undetected metabolites. Alternatively, using known paradigms for secondary metabolite biosynthesis, genetic information has been 'fished out' of DNA libraries resulting in the discovery of new natural products and isolation of gene clusters for known metabolites. Novel natural products have been discovered by expressing genetic data from uncultured organisms or difficult-to-manipulate strains in heterologous hosts. Furthermore, improvements in heterologous expression have not only helped to identify gene clusters but have also made it easier to manipulate these genes in order to generate new compounds. Finally, and perhaps the most crucial aspect of the efficient and prosperous use of the abundance of genetic information, novel enzyme chemistry continues to be discovered, which has aided our understanding of how natural products are biosynthesized de novo, and enabled us to rework the current paradigms for natural product biosynthesis. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For sequences that are highly divergent, there is often insufficient information to infer accurate alignments, and phylogenetic uncertainty may be high. One way to address this issue is to make use of protein structural information, since structures generally diverge more slowly than sequences. In this work, we extend a recently developed stochastic model of pairwise structural evolution to multiple structures on a tree, analytically integrating over ancestral structures to permit efficient likelihood computations under the resulting joint sequence-structure model. We observe that the inclusion of structural information significantly reduces alignment and topology uncertainty, and reduces the number of topology and alignment errors in cases where the true trees and alignments are known. In some cases, the inclusion of structure results in changes to the consensus topology, indicating that structure may contain additional information beyond that which can be obtained from sequences. We use the model to investigate the order of divergence of cytoglobins, myoglobins, and hemoglobins and observe a stabilization of phylogenetic inference: although a sequence-based inference assigns significant posterior probability to several different topologies, the structural model strongly favors one of these over the others and is more robust to the choice of data set.},

abstract = {Bacterial pathogens use different protein secretion systems to deliver virulence factors. Recently, a novel secretion system was discovered in several Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, and was designated as the type VI secretion system (T6SS). In Edwardsiella tarda, a partial E. tardavirulent protein (EVP) gene cluster was implicated in protein secretion. Here, we identified the entire EVP cluster as a T6SS and two additional secreted proteins (EvpI, a homologue of VgrG, and EvpP) were found. We systematically mutagenized all the 16 EVP genes and found that the secretion of EvpP was dependent on 13 EVP proteins including EvpC (a homologue of Hcp) and EvpI but not EvpD and EvpJ. All EVP mutants except DeltaevpD were attenuated in blue gourami fish. The 16 EVP proteins can be grouped according to their functions and cellular locations. The first group comprises 11 non-secreted and possibly intracellular apparatus proteins. Among them, EvpO, a putative ATPase which contained a Walker A motif, showed possible interactions with three EVP proteins (EvpA, EvpL and EvpN). The second group includes three secreted proteins (EvpC, EvpI and EvpP). The secretion of EvpC and EvpI is mutually dependent, and they are required for the secretion of EvpP. The interaction between EvpC and EvpP was demonstrated. Lastly, two proteins (EvpD and EvpJ) are not required for the T6SS-dependent secretion.},

abstract = {The culturability of several actinobacteria is controlled by resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs). These are proteins containing a c. 70-residue domain that adopts a lysozyme-like fold. The invariant catalytic glutamate residue found in lysozyme and various bacterial lytic transglycosylases is also conserved in the Rpf proteins. Rpf from Micrococcus luteus, the founder member of this protein family, is indeed a muralytic enzyme, as revealed by its activity in zymograms containing M. luteus cell walls and its ability to (i) cause lysis of Escherichia coli when expressed and secreted into the periplasm; (ii) release fluorescent material from fluorescamine-labelled cell walls of M. luteus; and (iii) hydrolyse the artificial lysozyme substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N,N',N''-triacetylchitotrioside. Rpf activity was reduced but not completely abolished when the invariant glutamate residue was altered. Moreover, none of the other acidic residues in the Rpf domain was absolutely required for muralytic activity. Replacement of one or both of the cysteine residues that probably form a disulphide bridge within Rpf impaired but did not completely abolish muralytic activity. The muralytic activities of the Rpf mutants were correlated with their abilities to stimulate bacterial culturability and resuscitation, consistent with the view that the biological activity of Rpf results directly or indirectly from its ability to cleave bonds in bacterial peptidoglycan.},

Later, Given (1960) examined one of the syntypes, stating that it was identical to specimens he used to describe C. zealandica, but a lectoype was not designated at this time. So, the aims of this paper are: (i) to provide a detailed description of the external morphology, mouthparts and male genitalia based on the syntypes of R. zealandicus; (ii) to compare these type specimens with the description by Given (1952); (iii) to compare the syntypes to establish if they are conspecific; (iv) to designate an appropriate lectotype and (v) to study a representative series of C. zealandica collected from throughout New Zealand to establish the status of the taxon currently known as C. zealandica. Differences between the syntype specimens, and Given's (1952) description of the New Zealand specimens were found. In addition, White's syntypes are not conspecific.

abstract = {Analyses of microbial genome sequences reveal numerous examples of gene clusters encoding proteins typically involved in complex natural product biosynthesis but not associated with the production of known natural products. In Streptomyces coelicolor M145 there are several gene clusters encoding new nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) systems not associated with known metabolites. Application of structure-based models for substrate recognition by NRPS adenylation domains predicts the amino acids incorporated into the putative peptide products of these systems, but the accuracy of these predictions is untested. Here we report the isolation and structure determination of the new tris-hydroxamate tetrapeptide iron chelator coelichelin from S. coelicolor using a genome mining approach guided by substrate predictions for the trimodular NRPS CchH, and we show that this enzyme, which lacks a C-terminal thioesterase domain, together with a homolog of enterobactin esterase (CchJ), are required for coelichelin biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that accurate prediction of adenylation domain substrate selectivity is possible and raise intriguing mechanistic questions regarding the assembly of a tetrapeptide by a trimodular NRPS.},

abstract = {The bacterial Type VI secretion system (T6SS) assembles from three major parts: a membrane complex that spans inner and outer membranes, a baseplate, and a sheath-tube polymer. The baseplate assembles around a tip complex with associated effectors and connects to the membrane complex by TssK. The baseplate assembly initiates sheath-tube polymerization, which in some organisms requires TssA. Here, we analyzed both ends of isolated non-contractile Vibrio cholerae sheaths by cryo-electron microscopy. Our analysis suggests that the baseplate, solved to an average 8.0 {\AA} resolution, is composed of six subunits of TssE/F2/G and the baseplate periphery is decorated by six TssK trimers. The VgrG/PAAR tip complex in the center of the baseplate is surrounded by a cavity, which may accommodate up to {\~{}}450 kDa of effector proteins. The distal end of the sheath, resolved to an average 7.5 {\AA} resolution, shows sixfold symmetry; however, its protein composition is unclear. Our structures provide an important step toward an atomic model of the complete T6SS assembly.},

abstract = {The Serratia entomophila antifeeding prophage (Afp) forms a phage-tail-like particle that acts on the New Zealand grass grub, Costelytra zealandica. An optimised expression and purification protocol for the Afp and its derivatives was developed. The ability to purify the Afp in conjunction with bioassays enabled the 3 day LD50 to be defined as approximately 500 Afp particles required to cause a cessation of feeding activity by the C. zealandica larva. Genetic manipulation allowed for construction of Afp variants. Genes (afp1-18) encoding components of Afp were expressed and their products purified allowing morphological assessment of the products by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Expression of afp1-15 resulted in the formation of a non- sheathed structure termed the tube-baseplate complex (TBC), composed of an irregular-length tube attached to a baseplate with associated tail fibers. Expression of afp1-16 produced mature, normal-length Afp particles, whereas co-expression of afp16 with afp1-15 in trans resulted in the formation of aberrant Afp particles of variable lengths. A C-terminally truncated Afp16 mutant resulted in a phenotype intermediate between mature Afp and TBC. Analysis of TEM images of purified Afp16 revealed a hexameric ring-like structure similar to that formed by the gp3 of phage T4 and gpU of phage $\lambda$. The addition of purified Afp16 to Afp unravelled by acidic treatment resulted in the formation of shorter tubes when sample pH was adjusted to 7 than those formed in the absence of Afp16. These results suggested that Afp16 terminates tube elongation and is involved in sheath formation. Assessment of purified Afp particles derived from pAF6 clones bearing transposon insertions in the ORF afp14 resulted in the production of mature Afp of shorter than regular lengths. The resultant lengths corresponded with the predicted length of the translated protein up to the transposon insertion site, suggesting that Afp14 is a ruler protein determining the length of the Afp. Subjecting the Afp and TBC to a variety of chemical treatments resulted in structural alterations. Bioinformatic analysis and comparison of Afp and TBC protein compositions in combination with the observed mode of Afp length control allowed the development of a model for Afp assembly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In vivo recombination of overlapping DNA fragments for assembly of large DNA constructs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae holds great potential for pathway engineering on a small laboratory scale as well as for automated high-throughput strain construction. However, the current in vivo assembly methods are not consistent with respect to yields of correctly assembled constructs and standardization of parts required for routine laboratory implementation has not been explored. Here, we present and evaluate an optimized and robust method for in vivo assembly of plasmids from overlapping DNA fragments in S. cerevisiae.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To minimize occurrence of misassembled plasmids and increase the versatility of the assembly platform, two main improvements were introduced; i) the essential elements of the vector backbone (yeast episome and selection marker) were disconnected and ii) standardized 60 bp synthetic recombination sequences non-homologous with the yeast genome were introduced at each flank of the assembly fragments. These modifications led to a 100 fold decrease in false positive transformants originating from the backbone as compared to previous methods. Implementation of the 60 bp synthetic recombination sequences enabled high flexibility in the design of complex expression constructs and allowed for fast and easy construction of all assembly fragments by PCR. The functionality of the method was demonstrated by the assembly of a 21 kb plasmid out of nine overlapping fragments carrying six glycolytic genes with a correct assembly yield of 95{\%}. The assembled plasmid was shown to be a high fidelity replica of the in silico design and all glycolytic genes carried by the plasmid were proven to be functional.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The presented method delivers a substantial improvement for assembly of multi-fragment expression vectors in S. cerevisiae. Not only does it improve the efficiency of in vivo assembly, but it also offers a versatile platform for easy and rapid design and assembly of synthetic constructs. The presented method is therefore ideally suited for the construction of complex pathways and for high throughput strain construction programs for metabolic engineering purposes. In addition its robustness and ease of use facilitate the construction of any plasmid carrying two or more genes.},

We identified {\~{}}10,000 candidate systems in bacterial genomes, where T1SS and T5SS were by far the most abundant and widespread. All these data are made available in a public database. The recently described T6SS(iii) and T9SS were restricted to Bacteroidetes, and T6SS(ii) to Francisella. The T2SS, T3SS, and T4SS were frequently encoded in single-copy in one locus, whereas most T1SS were encoded in two loci. The secretion systems of diderm Firmicutes were similar to those found in other diderms. Novel systems may remain to be discovered, since some clades of environmental bacteria lacked all known protein secretion systems. Our models can be fully customized, which should facilitate the identification of novel systems.},

Genomic comparison of these mycobacteriophages contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of viral evolution and provides compelling evidence for the role of illegitimate recombination in horizontal genetic exchange. The promiscuity of these recombination events results in the inclusion of many unexpected genes including those implicated in mycobacterial latency, the cellular and immune responses to mycobacterial infections, and autoimmune diseases such as human lupus. While the role of phages as vehicles of toxin genes is well established, these observations suggest a much broader involvement of phages in bacterial virulence and the host response to bacterial infections.},

abstract = {Protein secretion is a common property of pathogenic microbes. Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use at least 6 distinct extracellular protein secretion systems to export proteins through their multilayered cell envelope and in some cases into host cells. Among the most widespread is the newly recognized Type VI secretion system (T6SS) which is composed of 15-20 proteins whose biochemical functions are not well understood. Using crystallographic, biochemical, and bioinformatic analyses, we identified 3 T6SS components, which are homologous to bacteriophage tail proteins. These include the tail tube protein; the membrane-penetrating needle, situated at the distal end of the tube; and another protein associated with the needle and tube. We propose that T6SS is a multicomponent structure whose extracellular part resembles both structurally and functionally a bacteriophage tail, an efficient machine that translocates proteins and DNA across lipid membranes into cells.},

abstract = {The ability of protein chains to spontaneously form their spatial structures is a long-standing puzzle in molecular biology. Experimentally measured folding times of single-domain globular proteins range from microseconds to hours: the difference (10–11 orders of magnitude) is the same as that between the life span of a mosquito and the age of the universe. This review describes physical theories of rates of overcoming the free-energy barrier separating the natively folded (N) and unfolded (U) states of protein chains in both directions: “U-to-N” and “N-to-U”. In the theory of protein folding rates a special role is played by the point of thermodynamic (and kinetic) equilibrium between the native and unfolded state of the chain; here, the theory obtains the simplest form. Paradoxically, a theoretical estimate of the folding time is easier to get from consideration of protein unfolding (the “N-to-U” transition) rather than folding, because it is easier to outline a good unfolding pathway of any structure than a good folding pathway that leads to the stable fold, which is yet unknown to the folding protein chain. And since the rates of direct and reverse reactions are equal at the equilibrium point (as follows from the physical “detailed balance” principle), the estimated folding time can be derived from the estimated unfolding time. Theoretical analysis of the “N-to-U” transition outlines the range of protein folding rates in a good agreement with experiment. Theoretical analysis of folding (the “U-to-N” transition), performed at the level of formation and assembly of protein secondary structures, outlines the upper limit of protein folding times (i.e., of the time of search for the most stable fold). Both theories come to essentially the same results; this is not a surprise, because they describe overcoming one and the same free-energy barrier, although the way to the top of this barrier from the side of the unfolded state is very different from the way from the side of the native state; and both theories agree with experiment. In addition, they predict the maximal size of protein domains that fold under solely thermodynamic (rather than kinetic) control and explain the observed maximal size of the “foldable” protein domains.},

abstract = {The transcriptional regulatory protein RfaH controls expression of several operons that encode extracytoplasmic components in bacteria. Regulation by RfaH occurs during transcript elongation and depends on a 5′-proximal, transcribed nucleic acid sequence called ops that induces transcriptional pausing in vitro and in vivo. We report that RfaH recognizes RNA polymerase transcribing RfaH-regulated operons by interacting with the ops sequence in the exposed nontemplate DNA strand of ops-paused transcription complexes. Although RfaH delays escape from the ops pause, once escape occurs, RfaH enhances elongation by suppressing pausing and $\rho$-dependent termination without apparent involvement of other accessory proteins. This activity predicts a cumulative antitermination model for RfaH's regulation of ops-containing operons in vivo.},

abstract = {One hundred and eighteen different strains of Proteus vulgaris were investigated for bacteriocinogeny. These and an additional 44 strains of P. vulgaris were used as indicators. Sixty-seven of the strains had a non-transmissible killing effect on one or more of the indicator organisms and 30 of these 67 bacteriocins with different spectra of activity were further investigated. Individual bacteriocins killed from 5 to 87 of the P. vulgaris indicators and a number of 44 different P. mirabilis strains but had no action on strains of other species of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Broth cultures of bacteriocinogenic strains are inducible by ultraviolet light and yield bacteriocin titres of about 1/100. Activity is sedimentable by high-speed centrifugation. Electron microscopy of all 30 preparations revealed similar phage-tail-like structures with a contractile sheath round a hollow core. The structures consisted of protein and did not contain DNA. The particles resembled some pyocins and also the tail of a P. vulgaris transducing phage. In 2 preparations a few phage-like particles resembling other Proteus phages were also seen. Bacteriocin activity was always associated with uncontracted sheaths, and triggered tails did not adsorb to susceptible organisms. We conclude that the tail-like structures are the products of defective lysogeny. The high incidence of the latter state may be accounted for by the selection of genes favourable to the host which were originally acquired through transduction by lysogenization or lysogenic conversion. },

Time-lapse fluorescence light microscopy reveals that sheaths of the type VI secretion system cycle between assembly, quick contraction, disassembly and re-assembly. Whole-cell electron cryotomography further shows that the sheaths appear as long tubular structures in either extended or contracted conformations that are connected to the inner membrane by a distinct basal structure. These data support a model in which the contraction of the type VI secretion system sheath provides the energy needed to translocate proteins out of effector cells and into adjacent target cells.},

abstract = {Many animals and plants have symbiotic relationships with beneficial bacteria. Experimentally tractable models are necessary to understand the processes involved in the selective transmission of symbiotic bacteria. One such model is the transmission of the insect-pathogenic bacterial symbionts Photorhabdus spp. by Heterorhabditis bacteriophora infective juvenile (IJ)-stage nematodes. By observing egg-laying behavior and IJ development, it was determined that IJs develop exclusively via intrauterine hatching and matricide (i.e., endotokia matricida). By transiently exposing nematodes to fluorescently labeled symbionts, it was determined that symbionts infect the maternal intestine as a biofilm and then invade and breach the rectal gland epithelium, becoming available to the IJ offspring developing in the pseudocoelom. Cell- and stage-specific infection occurs again in the pre-IJ pharyngeal intestinal valve cells, which helps symbionts to persist as IJs develop and move to a new host. Synchronous with nematode development are changes in symbiont and host behavior (e.g., adherence versus invasion). Thus, Photorhabdus symbionts are maternally transmitted by an elaborate infectious process involving multiple selective steps in order to achieve symbiont-specific transmission.},

The term quorum sensing was originally coined to describe the mechanism underlying the onset of luminescence production in cultures of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Luminescence and, more generally, quorum sensing are important for V. fischeri to form a mutualistic symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. The symbiosis is established when V. fischeri cells migrate via flagella-based motility from the surrounding seawater into a specialized structure injuvenile squid called the light organ. The cells grow to high cell densities within the light organ where the infection persists over the lifetime of the animal. A hallmark of a successful symbiosis is the luminescence produced by V. fischeri that camouflages the squid at night by eliminating its shadow within the water column. While the regulatory networks governing quorum sensing are critical for properly regulating V. fischeri luminescence within the squid light organ, they also regulate luminescence-independent processes during symbiosis. In this review, we discuss the quorum-sensing network of $\backslash$r$\backslash$nV. fischeri and highlight its impact at various stages during host colonization.},

Here, we report the crystal structure of the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Sci1 TssJ lipoprotein, a two four-stranded $\beta$-sheets protein that exhibits a transthyretin fold with an additional $\alpha$-helical domain and a protruding loop. We showed that TssJ contacts TssM through this loop since a loop depleted mutant failed to interact with TssM in vitro or in vivo. Biophysical analysis of TssM and TssJ-TssM interaction suggest a structural model of the membrane-anchored outer shell of T6SS.

Electron microscopic examination of the concentrated competence-conferring activity revealed an occasional intact but empty virion and large numbers of free phage tails. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of this material confirmed that the competence-conferring activity contained only some, but not all, of the major virion proteins. The competence-conferring activity exhibited single-hit kinetics when assay cells and 80 alpha transfecting deoxyribonucleic acid were present in excess.

abstract = {Symbiotic relationships between animals and microorganisms are common in nature, yet the factors controlling the abundance and distributions of symbionts are mostly unknown. Aphids have an obligate association with the bacterium Buchnera aphidicola (the primary symbiont) that has been shown to contribute directly to aphid fitness. In addition, aphids sometimes harbor other vertically transmitted bacteria (secondary symbionts), for which few benefits of infection have been previously documented. We carried out experiments to determine the consequences of these facultative symbioses in Acyrthosiphon pisum (the pea aphid) for vulnerability of the aphid host to a hymenopteran parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, a major natural enemy in field populations. Our results show that, in a controlled genetic background, infection confers resistance to parasitoid attack by causing high mortality of developing parasitoid larvae. Compared with uninfected controls, experimentally infected aphids were as likely to be attacked by ovipositing parasitoids but less likely to support parasitoid development. This strong interaction between a symbiotic bacterium and a host natural enemy provides a mechanism for the persistence and spread of symbiotic bacteria.},

abstract = {Terrestrial arthropods are commonly infected with maternally inherited bacterial symbionts that cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, the outcome of crosses between symbiont-infected males and uninfected females is reproductive failure, increasing the relative fitness of infected females and leading to spread of the symbiont in the host population. CI symbionts have profound impacts on host genetic structure and ecology and may lead to speciation and the rapid evolution of sex determination systems. Cardinium hertigii, a member of the Bacteroidetes and symbiont of the parasitic wasp Encarsia pergandiella, is the only known bacterium other than the Alphaproteobacteria Wolbachia to cause CI. Here we report the genome sequence of Cardinium hertigii cEper1. Comparison with the genomes of CI-inducing Wolbachia pipientis strains wMel, wRi, and wPip provides a unique opportunity to pinpoint shared proteins mediating host cell interaction, including some candidate proteins for CI that have not previously been investigated. The genome of Cardinium lacks all major biosynthetic pathways but harbors a complete biotin biosynthesis pathway, suggesting a potential role for Cardinium in host nutrition. Cardinium lacks known protein secretion systems but encodes a putative phage-derived secretion system distantly related to the antifeeding prophage of the entomopathogen Serratia entomophila. Lastly, while Cardinium and Wolbachia genomes show only a functional overlap of proteins, they show no evidence of laterally transferred elements that would suggest common ancestry of CI in both lineages. Instead, comparative genomics suggests an independent evolution of CI in Cardinium and Wolbachia and provides a novel context for understanding the mechanistic basis of CI.},

abstract = {Using physical force to translocate macromolecules across a membrane has the advantage of being a universal solution independent of the properties of the target membrane. However, physically punching a stiff membrane is not a trivial task and three things are necessary for success: a sharp tip, a source of energy, and the ability to strongly bind to the target. In this review we describe the basic mechanism of membrane puncturing by contractile nanomachines with a focus on the T4 phage, R-type pyocin, and the bacterial Type VI secretion system (T6SS) based on recent studies of the structures and dynamics of their assembly. Many bacterial nanomachines share a common ancestry and mode of action with contractile-tailed phages. Recent advances in cryoelectron microscopy have allowed unprecedented insight into the structures of R-type pyocin and the T4 baseplate in both the pre- and post-contraction state. Studies on the structures and dynamics of several components of the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) provide a detailed picture of T6SS's mode of action and assembly. These recent studies unravel a unique mechanism for the penetration of cellular membranes.},

abstract = {Photorhabdus luminescens is a gram-negative enteric bacterium that is found in association with entomopathogenic nematodes of the family Heterorhabditidae. The nematodes infect a variety of soil-dwelling insects. Upon entering an insect host, the nematode releases P. luminescens cells from its intestinal tract, and the bacteria quickly establish a lethal septicemia. When grown in peptone broth, in the absence of the nematodes, the bacteria produce a protein toxin complex that is lethal when fed to, or injected into the hemolymph of, Manduca sexta larvae and several other insect species. The toxin purified as a protein complex which has an estimated molecular weight of 1,000,000 and contains no protease, phospholipase, or hemolytic activity and only a trace of lipase activity. The purified toxin possesses insecticidal activity whether injected or given orally. Analyses of the denatured complex by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed it to be composed of several protein subunits ranging in size from 30 to 200 kDa. The complex was further separated by native gel electrophoresis into three components, two of which retained insecticidal activity. The purified native toxin complex was found to be active in nanogram concentrations against insects representing four orders of the class Insecta.},

Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format.

abstract = {3,5-Dihydroxy-4-isopropylstilbene is a natural phytoalexin and was first identified as bacterial secondary metabolites. The aim of this study is to investigate in vitro antioxidant and anticancer activity of 3,5-dihydroxy-4-isopropystilbene purified from the cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus sp. N strain associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by five separate methods: free radical scavenging, reducing power assay, chelating effects on ferrous ions, NBT superoxide radical scavenging assay and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The stilbene recorded powerful antioxidant activity at various antioxidant systems in vitro. The superoxide radical scavenging (92.1 {\%}) and hydroxyl radical scavenging (83.4 {\%}) activities of the stilbenes at 100 $\mu$g/ml were higher than the butylated hydroxyanisole, the known antioxidant agent. Anticancer activity of stilbene was tested against breast cancer (MDAM B-231), cervical cancer (HeLa), lung cancer (A 549), colon cancer (HTL 116) cell lines using MTT method. The induction of apoptosis was studied by morphological analysis, apoptotic cell staining, caspase 3 activation assay and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Stilbene induced significant morphological changes and DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis in HeLa cells. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide stained cells indicated apoptosis induction by stilbene. Up-regulation of caspase 3 activity was also found in cells treated with stilbene. Flow cytometry analysis showed an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in sub G0 phase (2.4 {\%} in control plates to 11.4 {\%} in 25 $\mu$g/ml of stilbene) confirming the stilbene induced apoptosis. The results of the present study showed that stilbene demonstrated a strong antioxidant and anticancer effects. These suggest that stilbene may be used as possible natural antioxidant and anticancer agents to control various human diseases.},

abstract = {Pyocins are produced by more than 90{\%} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and each strain may synthesise several pyocins. The pyocin genes are located on the P. aeruginosa chromosome and their activities are inducible by mutagenic agents such as mitomycin C. Three types of pyocins are described. (i) R-type pyocins resemble non-flexible and contractile tails of bacteriophages. They provoke a depolarisation of the cytoplasmic membrane in relation with pore formation. (ii) F-type pyocins also resemble phage tails, but with a flexible and non-contractile rod-like structure. (iii) S-type pyocins are colicin-like, protease-sensitive proteins. They are constituted of two components. The large component carries the killing activity (DNase activity for pyocins S1, S2, S3, AP41; tRNase for pyocin S4; channel-forming activity for pyocin S5). It interacts with the small component (immunity protein). The synthesis of pyocins starts when a mutagen increases the expression of the recA gene and activates the RecA protein, which cleaves the repressor PrtR, liberating the expression of the protein activator gene prtN. R and F-pyocins are derived from an ancestral gene, with similarities to the P2 phage family and the ?? phage family, respectively. The killing domains of S1, S2, AP41 pyocins show a close evolutionary relationship with E2 group colicins, S4 pyocin with colicin E5, and S5 pyocin with colicins Ia, and Ib. ?? 2002 Soci??t?? fran??aise de biochimie et biologie mol??culaire / ??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {The nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is the vector for transmitting the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens between insect larvae. The dauer juvenile (DJ) stage nematode selectively retains P. luminescens in its intestine until it releases the bacteria into the hemocoel of an insect host. We report the results of studying the transmission of the bacteria by its nematode vector. Cells of P. luminescens labeled with green fluorescent protein preferentially colonized a region of the DJ intestine immediately behind the basal bulb, extending for various distances toward the anus. Incubation of DJ nematodes in vitro in insect hemolymph induced regurgitation of the bacteria. Following a 30-min lag, the bacteria migrated in a gradual and staggered movement toward and ultimately exited the mouth. This regurgitation reaction was induced by a low-molecular-weight, heat- and protease-stable, anionic component present in arthropod hemolymph and in supernatants from insect cell cultures. Nematodes anesthetized with levamisole or treated with the antihelmenthic agent ivermectin did not release their bacteria into hemolymph. The ability to visualize P. luminescens in the DJ nematode intestine provides the first clues to the mechanism of release of the bacteria during infection of insect larvae. This and the partial characterization of a component of hemolymph triggering release of the bacteria render this fascinating example of both a mutualistic symbiosis and disease transmission amenable to future genetic and molecular study.},

Using Dictyostelium discoideum as a model host, we have identified a virulence mechanism in a non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strain that involves extracellular translocation of proteins that lack N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequences. Accordingly, we have named these genes "VAS" genes for virulence-associated secretion, and we propose that these genes encode a prototypic "type VI" secretion system. We show that vas genes are required for cytotoxicity of V. cholerae cells toward Dictyostelium amoebae and mammalian J774 macrophages by a contact-dependent mechanism. A large number of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens carry genes homologous to vas genes and potential effector proteins secreted by this pathway (i.e., hemolysin-coregulated protein and VgrG). Mutations in vas homologs in other bacterial species have been reported to attenuate virulence in animals and cultured macrophages. Thus, the genes encoding the VAS-related, type VI secretion system likely play an important conserved function in microbial pathogenesis and represent an additional class of targets for vaccine and antimicrobial drug-based therapies.},

abstract = {The multicomponent type VI secretion system (T6SS) mediates the transport of effector proteins by puncturing target membranes. T6SSs are suggested to form a contractile nanomachine, functioning similar to the cell-puncturing device of tailed bacteriophages. The T6SS members VipA/VipB form tubular complexes and are predicted to function in analogy to viral tail sheath proteins by providing the energy for secretion via contraction. The ATPase ClpV disassembles VipA/VipB tubules in vitro, but the physiological relevance of tubule disintegration remained unclear. Here, we show that VipA/VipB tubules localize near-perpendicular to the inner membrane of Vibrio cholerae cells and exhibit repetitive cycles of elongation, contraction and disassembly. VipA/VipB tubules are decorated by ClpV in vivo and become static in DeltaclpV cells, indicating that ClpV is required for tubule removal. VipA/VipB tubules mislocalize in DeltaclpV cells and exhibit a reduced frequency of tubule elongation, indicating that ClpV also suppresses the spontaneous formation of contracted, non-productive VipA/VipB tubules. ClpV activity is restricted to the contracted state of VipA/VipB, allowing formation of functional elongated tubules at a T6SS assembly. Targeting of an unrelated ATPase to VipA/VipB is sufficient to replace ClpV function in vivo, suggesting that ClpV activity is autonomously regulated by VipA/VipB conformation.},

abstract = {We have expanded the reference set of proteins used in SELCON3 by including 11 additional proteins (selected from the reference sets of Yang and co-workers and Keiderling and co-workers). Depending on the wavelength range and whether or not denatured proteins are included in the reference set, five reference sets were constructed with the number of reference proteins varying from 29 to 48. The performance of three popular methods for estimating protein secondary structure fractions from CD spectra (implemented in software packages CONTIN, SELCON3, and CDSSTR) and a variant of CONTIN, CONTIN/LL, that incorporates the variable selection method in the locally linearized model in CONTIN, were examined using the five reference sets described here, and a 22-protein reference set. Secondary structure assignments from DSSP were used in the analysis. The performances of all three methods were comparable, in spite of the differences in the algorithms used in the three software packages. While CDSSTR performed the best with a smaller reference set and larger wavelength range, and CONTIN/LL performed the best with a larger reference set and smaller wavelength range, the performances for individual secondary structures were mixed. Analyzing protein CD spectra using all three methods should improve the reliability of predicted secondary structural fractions. The three programs are provided in CDPro software package and have been modified for easier use with the different reference sets described in this paper.

Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistically parameterized models of bacterial evolution, and achieves convergence in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences. Gubbins is appropriate for reconstructing the recent evolutionary history of a variety of haploid genotype alignments, as it makes no assumptions about the underlying mechanism of recombination.

abstract = {Four genes on a genomic fragment from Xenorhabdus nematophilus PMFI296 were shown to be involved in insecticidal activity towards three commercially important insect species. Each gene was expressed individually and in combinations in Escherichia coli, and the insecticidal activity of the lysates was determined. The combined four genes (xptA1, xptA2, xptB1, and xptC1), in E. coli, showed activity towards Pieris brassicae, Pieris rapae, and Heliothis virescens. The genes xptA1, xptB1, and xptC1 were involved in expressing activity towards P. rapae and P. brassicae, while the genes xptA2, xptB1, and xptC1 were needed for activity towards H. virescens. When each of these three genes was expressed individually in E. coli and the cell lysates were used in insect assays or mixed and then used, insecticidal activity was detected at a very low level. If the genes xptB1 and xptC1 were expressed in the same E. coli cell and this cell lysate was mixed with cells expressing xptA1, activity was restored to P. rapae and P. brassicae. Similarly mixing XptB1/C1 lysate with XptA2 lysate restored activity towards H. virescens. Individual gene disruptions in X. nematophilus PMFI296 reduced activity to insects; this activity was restored by complementation with cells expressing either xptA1 or xptA2 for their respective disruptions or E. coli expressing both xptB1 and xptC1 for individual disruptions of either of these genes. The genes xptA2, xptC1, and xptB1 were expressed as an operon in PMFI296 and inactivation of xptA2 or xptC1 resulted in silencing of downstream gene(s), while xptA1 was expressed as a single gene. Therefore, the two three gene product combinations interact with each other to produce good insecticidal activity.},

abstract = {A highly virulent Serratia proteamaculans strain, AGR96X, exhibiting specific pathogenicity against larvae of the New Zealand grass grub ( Costelytra giveni ; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and the New Zealand manuka beetle ( Pyronota festiva and P. setosa ; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), was isolated from a diseased grass grub larva. A 12-day median lethal dose of 4.89 ± 0.92 × 10 3 cells per grass grub larva was defined for AGR96X, and death occurred within 5--12 days following ingestion of a high bacterial dose. During the infection period, the bacterium rapidly multiplied within the insect host and invaded the hemocoel, leading to a mean bacterial load of 8.2 × 10 9 cells per larva at 6 days post-ingestion. Genome sequencing of strain AGR96X revealed the presence of a variant of the Serratia entomophila anti-feeding prophage (Afp), a tailocin designated AfpX. Unlike the Afp, AfpX contains two Afp16 tail-length termination protein orthologes and two putative toxin components. A 37-kb DNA fragment encoding the AfpX-associated region was cloned, transformed into Escherichia coli , and fed to C. giveni and Pyronota larvae, causing mortality. In addition, deletion of the afpX15 putative chaperone component abolished the virulence of AGR96X. Unlike the S. entomophila Afp, the AfpX tailocin could be induced by mitomycin C. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of Afp-like particles of varying lengths, and when the purified AfpX tailocin was fed to grass grub or manuka beetle larvae, they underwent similar phenotypic changes to larvae fed AGR96X.},

Components that have been partially characterised include an IcmF homologue, the ATPase ClpV, a regulatory FHA domain protein and the secreted VgrG and Hcp proteins. Type VI secretion is clearly a key virulence factor for some important pathogenic bacteria and has been implicated in the translocation of a potential effector protein into eukaryotic cells by at least one organism (Vibrio cholerae). However, type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are widespread in nature and not confined to known pathogens. In accordance with the general rule that the expression of protein secretion systems is tightly regulated, expression of type VI secretion is controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The speB gene of Escherichia coli encodes the enzyme agmatine ureohydrolase (AUH). AUH catalyzes the hydrolysis of agmatine to urea and putrescine in one of the two polyamine biosynthetic pathways in E. coli. Sequencing of a 2.97-kilobase-pair fragment of the E. coli chromosome containing speB revealed the presence of three intact open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2 on one strand and ORF3 on the opposite strand, as well as a truncated ORF, ORF4, which terminated 92 kilobase pairs upstream from ORF3. ORF3 contained the coding sequence of the speB gene, as confirmed by complementation analysis. Two ORF3 transcripts were detected: a shorter transcript that included only ORF3 and a longer transcript that included both ORF3 and ORF4. The short transcript was abundantly expressed when the ORF4 sequences were deleted, but when ORF4 and its upstream sequences were present, the polycistronic message predominated and the amount of the monocistronic message was drastically reduced. The promoter from which the shorter transcript was produced contained a TATACT sequence at position -12, but sequences upstream from the -12 position seemed to be irrelevant for promoter activity. The predicted amino acid sequence of AUH contained three regions of high homology to the arginases of yeasts, rats, and humans.},

We report the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of gpV, the protein comprising the major portion of the noncontractile phage lambda tail tube. This structure is very similar to a previously solved tail tube protein from a contractile-tailed phage, providing the first direct evidence of an evolutionary connection between these 2 distinct types of phage tails. A remarkable structural similarity is also seen to Hcp1, a component of the bacterial type VI secretion system. The hexameric structure of Hcp1 and its ability to form long tubes are strikingly reminiscent of gpV when it is polymerized into a tail tube. These data coupled with other similarities between phage and type VI secretion proteins support an evolutionary relationship between these systems. Using Hcp1 as a model, we propose a polymerization mechanism for gpV involving several disorder-to-order transitions.},

In 2007, Dong et al reported that the addition of trace amounts of protease to crystallization trials--in situ proteolysis--significantly increased the number of proteins in a given set that produce diffraction quality crystals. 69 proteins that had previously resisted structure determination were subjected to crystallization with in situ proteolysis and ten crystallized in a form that led to structure determination (14.5{\%} success rate). Here we apply in situ proteolysis to over 270 new soluble proteins that had failed in the past to produce crystals suitable for structure determination. These proteins had produced no crystals, crystals that diffracted poorly, or produced twinned and/or unmanageable diffraction data. The new set includes yeast and prokaryotic proteins, enzymes essential to protozoan parasites, and human proteins such as GTPases, chromatin remodeling proteins, and tyrosine kinases. 34 proteins yielded deposited crystal structures of 2.8 A resolution or better, for an overall 12.6{\%} success rate, and at least ten more yielded well-diffracting crystals presently in refinement. The success rate among proteins that had previously crystallized was double that of those that had never before yielded crystals. The overall success rate is similar to that observed in the smaller study, and appears to be higher than any other method reported to rescue stalled protein crystallography projects.},

@article{Buetow2001,
abstract = {Certain uropathogenic and neonatal meningitis-causing strains of Escherichia coli express a 114 kDa protein toxin called cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1). The toxin causes alteration of the host cell actin cytoskeleton and promotes bacterial invasion of blood-brain barrier endothelial cells. CNF1 belongs to a unique group of large cytotoxins that cause constitutive activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. This group also includes E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 2 (CNF2, 114 kDa) and dermonecrotic toxins (DNT, 159 kDa) of Bordetella spp. with related sequences occuring in Yersinia spp. Here we show that the catalytic region of CNF1 exhibits a novel protein fold as determined by its 1.83 {\AA} resolution crys-tal structure. The structure reveals that CNF1 has a Cys-His-main chain oxygen catalytic triad reminiscent of enzymes belonging to the catalytic triad superfamily. The position of the catalytic Cys residue at the base of a deep pocket restricts access to potential substrates and helps explain the high speci-ficity of this and related toxins. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is a 114 kDa toxin expressed by certain extraintestinal strains of pathogenic Eschericia coli, including those that cause urinary tract infections and neonatal meningitis 1,2 . A role for CNF1 in virulence is sup-ported by epidemiological evidence 2 and by experiments using isogenic CNF1 knockout strains of E. coli in animal models of neonatal meningitis (K.S. Kim, pers. comm.) and urinary tract infection 32 . In most cell lines, constitutive activation of Rho, a small GTPase that regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression, by CNF1 leads to formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, membrane ruffling and inhibition of cytokinesis with subsequent multinucleation 1 . Prolonged exposure of nonphago-cytic mammalian cells to CNF1 also promotes intracellular inva-sion by E. coli 3 , a process that may be related to crossing blood-brain barrier endothelial cells in meningitis. Further-more, CNF1 at high concentration promotes apoptosis in blad-der epithelial cells, which may result in allowing E. coli access to deeper tissues in urinary tract infections 4 . CNF1, CNF2 and the Bordetella dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) activate Rho family members constitutively through site-specific deamidation of a Gln residue to Glu (Gln 63 in RhoA, and Gln 61 in Rac and Cdc42) 5,6 . This glutamine is implicated in stabilizing the transition state and activating a water molecule during GTP hydrolysis. Site-specific deamidation is a rare enzymatic activity found in the CheB bacterial signaling pathway 7 and is implicated in the regulation of mammalian protein kinase A 8 . Site-specific deamidation of Rho by toxins greatly impairs the ability of Rho to hydrolyze GTP, with or without the assistance of GTPase acti-vating proteins, and, therefore, places Rho in a constitutively activated state. These toxins, highly specific for Rho proteins, can also constitutively activate Rho by transglutamination of the same glutamine residue in a reaction chemically similar to deamidation 9,10 . In contrast to mammalian transglutaminases that modify a broad spectrum of targets, CNF1 acts only on members of the Rho family 9 . In addition, whereas mammalian tissue transglutaminase modifies three of the five RhoA gluta-mines, CNF1 is specific to Gln 63 (ref. 9). We report here the X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic region of CNF1 (residues 720–1,014, called CNF1-C), which when introduced into target cells is sufficient to cause morpho-logical changes characteristic of intact CNF1 (ref. 9). The struc-ture has a novel protein fold and an active site reminiscent of the Fig. 1 Structure of CNF1-C. a, C$\alpha$ trace in stereo view. b, Ribbons repre-sentation ($\alpha$-helices are blue, $\beta$-strands red and coils green). c, Topology representation ($\alpha$-helices as rectangles and $\beta$-strands as arrows) with the catalytic groups (Cys 866, His 881 and main chain carbonyl of Val 833) indicated.

This first viral-host interaction would determine subsequent infection steps and the fate of the entire infection process. A basic understating of the underlining mechanism of initial virus-host binding is a prerequisite for establishing the nature of viral infection. Bacteriophage $\lambda$ and its host Escherichia coli serve as an excellent paradigm for this purpose. $\lambda$ phages bind to specific receptors, LamB, on the host cell surface during the infection process. The interaction of bacteriophage $\lambda$ with the LamB receptor has been the topic of many studies, resulting in wealth of information on the structure, biochemical properties and molecular biology of this system. Recently, imaging studies using fluorescently labeled phages and its receptor unveil the role of spatiotemporal dynamics and divulge the importance of stochasticity from hidden variables in the infection outcomes. The scope of this article is to review the present state of research on the interaction of bacteriophage $\lambda$ and its E. coli receptor, LamB.},

This study presents evidence for the putative mobility of the sep genes of pADAP. Southern blot analysis showed that orthologues of the sep genes reside on plasmids within S. entomophila, S. liquefaciens, S. proteamaculans, and a plasmid from Yersinia frederiksenii. Three plasmids hybridized to the pADAP sep virulence-associated region but not the pADAP replication and conjugation regions. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of the Y. frederiksenii sep-like genes, designated tcYF1 and tcYF2, showed that they had 88{\%} and 87{\%} DNA identity to sepA and sepB, respectively.

Since multiple alignments are usually employed at the very start of data analysis pipelines, it is crucial to ensure high alignment quality. We describe a simple, yet elegant, solution to assess the biological accuracy of alignments automatically. Our approach is based on the comparison of several alignments of the same sequences. We introduce two functions to compare alignments: the average overlap score and the multiple overlap score. The former identifies difficult alignment cases by expressing the similarity among several alignments, while the latter estimates the biological correctness of individual alignments. We implemented both functions in the MUMSA program and demonstrate the overall robustness and accuracy of both functions on three large benchmark sets.},

We recently developed a coalescent-based method, ASTRAL, which is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model and which is more accurate than other coalescent-based methods on the datasets we examined. ASTRAL runs in polynomial time, by constraining the search space using a set of allowed ‘bipartitions'.

abstract = {Communities of microorganisms form thin coats across solid surfaces in the sea. Larvae of many marine invertebrates use biofilm components as cues to appropriate settlement sites. Research on the tube-dwelling polychaete worm Hydroides elegans, a globally common member of biofouling communities, is described to exemplify approaches to understanding biofilm bacteria as a source of settlement cues and larvae as bearers of receptors for bacterial cues. The association of species of the bacterial genus Pseudoalteromonas with larval settlement in many phyla is described, and the question of whether cues are soluble or surface-bound is reviewed, concluding that most evidence points to surface-bound cues. Seemingly contradictory data for stimulation of barnacle settlement are discussed; possibly both explanations are true. Paleontological evidence reveals a relationship between metazoans and biofilms very early in metazoan evolution, and thus the receptors for bacterial cues of invertebrate larvae are very old and possibly unique. Finally, despite more than 60 years of intense investigation, we still know very little about either the bacterial ligands that stimulate larval settlement or the cellular basis of their detection by larvae.},

abstract = {We identify and characterize a gene cluster in El Tor Vibrio cholerae that encodes a cytotoxic activity for HEp-2 cells in vitro. This gene cluster contains four genes and is physically linked to the cholera toxin (CTX) element in the V. cholerae genome. We demonstrate by using insertional mutagenesis that this gene cluster is required for the cytotoxic activity. The toxin, RtxA, resembles members of the RTX (repeats in toxin) toxin family in that it contains a GD-rich repeated motif. Like other RTX toxins, its activity depends on an activator, RtxC, and an associated ABC transporter system, RtxB and RtxD. In V. cholerae strains of the classical biotype, a deletion within the gene cluster removes rtxC and eliminates cytotoxic activity. Other strains, including those of the current cholera pandemic, contain a functional gene cluster and display cytotoxic activity. Thus, the RTX gene cluster in El Tor O1 and O139 strains might have contributed significantly to their emergence. Furthermore, the RTX toxin of V. cholerae may be associated with residual adverse properties displayed by certain live, attenuated cholera vaccines.},

Recombinant protein assembles into different length polysheaths during expression in the cell, which complicates the preparation of protein crystals for its spatial structure determination. To design soluble monomeric gp18 mutants unable to form polysheaths and useful for crystallization, we have used Bal31 nuclease for generation deletions inside gene 18 encoding the Ile507-Gly530 region. Small deletions in the region of Ile507-Ile522 do not affect the protein assembly into polysheaths. Protein synthesis termination occurs because of reading frame failure in the location of deletions. Some fragments of gp18 containing short pseudo-accidental sequence in the C-terminal, while being soluble, have lost the ability for polysheath assembly. For the first time we succeeded in obtaining crystals of a soluble gp18 fragment containing 510 amino acids which, according to trypsin resistance, is similar to native protein monomer.},

The algorithm is approximately 4 times faster than CE and 20 times faster than DALI and SAL. On average, the resulting structure alignments have higher accuracy and coverage than those provided by these most often-used methods. TM-align is applied to an all-against-all structure comparison of 10 515 representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a sequence identity cutoff {\textless}95{\%}: 1996 distinct folds are found when a TM-score threshold of 0.5 is used. We also use TM-align to match the models predicted by TASSER for solved non-homologous proteins in PDB. For both folded and misfolded models, TM-align can almost always find close structural analogs, with an average root mean square deviation, RMSD, of 3 A and 87{\%} alignment coverage. Nevertheless, there exists a significant correlation between the correctness of the predicted structure and the structural similarity of the model to the other proteins in the PDB. This correlation could be used to assist in model selection in blind protein structure predictions. The TM-align program is freely downloadable at http://bioinformatics.buffalo.edu/TM-align.},

abstract = {The localization of the LapA protein to the cell surface is a key step required by Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 to irreversibly attach to a surface and form a biofilm. LapA is a member of a diverse family of predicted bacterial adhesins, and although lacking a high degree of sequence similarity, family members do share common predicted domains. Here, using mutational analysis, we determine the significance of each domain feature of LapA in relation to its export and localization to the cell surface and function in biofilm formation. Our previous work showed that the N terminus of LapA is required for cleavage by the periplasmic cysteine protease LapG and release of the adhesin from the cell surface under conditions unfavorable for biofilm formation. We define an additional critical region of the N terminus of LapA required for LapG proteolysis. Furthermore, our results suggest that the domains within the C terminus of LapA are not absolutely required for biofilm formation, export, or localization to the cell surface, with the exception of the type I secretion signal, which is required for LapA export and cell surface localization. In contrast, deletion of the central repetitive region of LapA, consisting of 37 repeats of 100 amino acids, results in an inability to form a biofilm. We also used single-molecule atomic force microscopy to further characterize the role of these domains in biofilm formation on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. These studies represent the first detailed analysis of the domains of the LapA family of biofilm adhesin proteins.},

abstract = {Francisella tularensis is an intracellular pathogen that causes the fatal zoonotic disease tularaemia. Critical for its pathogenesis is the ability of the phagocytosed bacteria to escape into the cell cytosol. For this, the bacteria use a non-canonical type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded on the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI). Here we show that in F. novicida T6SS assembly initiates at the bacterial poles both in vitro and within infected macrophages. T6SS dynamics and function depends on the general purpose ClpB unfoldase, which specifically colocalizes with contracted sheaths and is required for their disassembly. T6SS assembly depends on iglF, iglG, iglI and iglJ, whereas pdpC, pdpD, pdpE and anmK are dispensable. Importantly, strains lacking pdpC and pdpD are unable to escape from phagosome, activate AIM2 inflammasome or cause disease in mice. This suggests that PdpC and PdpD are T6SS effectors involved in phagosome rupture.},

@article{Boyer2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of hundreds of bacterial genomes allowed a comparative genomic study of the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), recently discovered as being involved in pathogenesis. By combining comparative and phylogenetic approaches using more than 500 prokaryotic genomes, we characterized the global T6SS genetic structure in terms of conservation, evolution and genomic organization. RESULTS: This genome wide analysis allowed the identification of a set of 13 proteins constituting the T6SS protein core and a set of conserved accessory proteins. 176 T6SS loci (encompassing 92 different bacteria) were identified and their comparison revealed that T6SS-encoded genes have a specific conserved genetic organization. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the core genes showed that lateral transfer of the T6SS is probably its major way of dissemination among pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the sequence analysis of the VgrG proteins, proposed to be exported in a T6SS-dependent way, confirmed that some C-terminal regions possess domains showing similarities with adhesins or proteins with enzymatic functions. CONCLUSION: The core of T6SS is composed of 13 proteins, conserved in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Subclasses of T6SS differ in regulatory and accessory protein content suggesting that T6SS has evolved to adapt to various microenvironments and specialized functions. Based on these results, new functional hypotheses concerning the assembly and function of T6SS proteins are proposed.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli DH10B was designed for the propagation of large insert DNA library clones. It is used extensively, taking advantage of properties such as high DNA transformation efficiency and maintenance of large plasmids. The strain was constructed by serial genetic recombination steps, but the underlying sequence changes remained unverified. We report the complete genomic sequence of DH10B by using reads accumulated from the bovine sequencing project at Baylor College of Medicine and assembled with DNAStar's SeqMan genome assembler. The DH10B genome is largely colinear with that of the wild-type K-12 strain MG1655, although it is substantially more complex than previously appreciated, allowing DH10B biology to be further explored. The 226 mutated genes in DH10B relative to MG1655 are mostly attributable to the extensive genetic manipulations the strain has undergone. However, we demonstrate that DH10B has a 13.5-fold higher mutation rate than MG1655, resulting from a dramatic increase in insertion sequence (IS) transposition, especially IS150. IS elements appear to have remodeled genome architecture, providing homologous recombination sites for a 113,260-bp tandem duplication and an inversion. DH10B requires leucine for growth on minimal medium due to the deletion of leuLABCD and harbors both the relA1 and spoT1 alleles causing both sensitivity to nutritional downshifts and slightly lower growth rates relative to the wild type. Finally, while the sequence confirms most of the reported alleles, the sequence of deoR is wild type, necessitating reexamination of the assumed basis for the high transformability of DH10B.},

However, the fine morphology and structural composition of carotovoricin Er remained to be studied because a large amount of contracted carotovoricin Er were present in the bacteriocin preparations so far obtained. To obtain intact carotovoricin Er and its major parts, we developed simple and efficient purification methods including the use of sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 10-20{\%} (v/v) ethanol. Electron microscopy for the purified carotovoricin Er showed the presence of a novel antenna-like structure at the proximal end of the phage-tail-like particle, which consisted of a sheath-and-core part, a baseplate, and tail fibers. Contracted sheath and inner core were purified as hollow cylindrical structures with longitudinal lengths of 69 and 174 nm, respectively, and tail fibers were purified as a fibrous structure with length of 63 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the presence of single major proteins of 50, 20, and 68 kDa in the isolated sheath, core, and tail fiber, respectively. Three other minor proteins of 46, 44, and 35 kDa were also identified as the structural proteins of carotovoricin Er, which may be the candidate proteins for the antenna-like and the base plate structures. Thus carotovoricin Er consists of at least 6 protein components.},

abstract = {Biological diversity arises among genetically equal subpopulations in the same environment, a phenomenon called phenotypic heterogeneity. The life cycle of the enteric bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens involves a symbiotic interaction with nematodes as well as a pathogenic association with insect larvae. P. luminescens exists in two distinct phenotypic forms designated as primary (1{\"{i}}¿½) and secondary (2{\"{i}}¿½). In contrast to 1{\"{i}}¿½ cells, 2{\"{i}}¿½ cells are non-pigmented due to the absence of natural compounds, especially anthraquinones (AQs). We identified a novel type of transcriptional regulator, AntJ, which activates expression of the antA-I operon responsible for AQ production. AntJ heterogeneously activates the AQ production in single P. luminescens 1{\"{i}}¿½ cells, and blocks AQ production in 2{\"{i}}¿½ cells. AntJ contains a proposed ligand-binding WYL-domain, which is widespread among bacteria. AntJ is one of the rare examples of regulators that mediate heterogeneous gene expression by altering activity rather than copy number in single cells.},

abstract = {We have constructed a series of plasmid vectors (pBAD vectors) containing the PBAD promoter of the araBAD (arabinose) operon and the gene encoding the positive and negative regulator of this promoter, araC. Using the phoA gene and phoA fusions to monitor expression in these vectors, we show that the ratio of induction/repression can be 1,200-fold, compared with 50-fold for PTAC-based vectors. phoA expression can be modulated over a wide range of inducer (arabinose) concentrations and reduced to extremely low levels by the presence of glucose, which represses expression. Also, the kinetics of induction and repression are very rapid and significantly affected by the ara allele in the host strain. Thus, the use of this system which can be efficiently and rapidly turned on and off allows the study of important aspects of bacterial physiology in a very simple manner and without changes of temperature. We have exploited the tight regulation of the PBAD promoter to study the phenotypes of null mutations of essential genes and explored the use of pBAD vectors as an expression system.},

abstract = {The role of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs) in pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium infection in the chicken is poorly studied, while many studies have been completed in murine models. The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is a recently described protein secretion system in Gram-negative bacteria. The genus Salmonella contains five phylogenetically distinct T6SS encoded in differentially distributed genomic islands. S. Typhimurium harbors a T6SS encoded in SPI-6 (T6SSSPI-6), which contributes to the ability of Salmonella to colonize mice. On the other hand, serotype Gallinarum harbors a T6SS encoded in SPI-19 (T6SSSPI-19) that is required for colonization of chicks. In this work, we investigated the role of T6SSSPI-6 in infection of chicks by S. Typhimurium. Oral infection of White Leghorn chicks showed that a $\Delta$T6SSSPI-6 mutant had reduced colonization of the gut and internal organs, compared with the wild-type strain. Transfer of the intact T6SSSPI-6 gene cluster into the T6SS mutant restored bacterial colonization. In addition, our results showed that transfer of T6SSSPI-19 from S. Gallinarum to the $\Delta$T6SSSPI-6 mutant of S. Typhimurium not only complemented the colonization defect but also resulted in a transient increase in the colonization of the cecum and ileum of chicks at days 1 and 3 post-infection. Our data indicates that T6SSSPI-6 contributes to chicken colonization and suggests that both T6SSSPI-6 and T6SSSPI-19 perform similar functions in vivo despite belonging to different phylogenetic families.},

abstract = {Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers part of its tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid, the transferred or T-DNA, to plants during tumourigenesis. This represents the only example of naturally occurring trans-kingdom transfer of genetic material. Here we report that A.tumefaciens can transfer its T-DNA not only to plant cells, but also to another eukaryote, namely the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Ti plasmid virulence (vir) genes that mediate T-DNA transfer to plants were found to be essential for transfer to yeast as well. Transgenic S.cerevisiae strains were analysed for their T-DNA content. Results showed that T-DNA circles were formed in yeast with precise fusions between the left and right borders. Such T-DNA circles were stably maintained by the yeast if the replicator from the yeast 2 mu plasmid was present in the T-DNA. Integration of T-DNA in the S.cerevisiae genome was found to occur via homologous recombination. This contrasts with integration in the plant genome, where T-DNA integrates preferentially via illegitimate recombination. Our results thus suggest that the process of T-DNA integration is predominantly determined by host factors.},

abstract = {Immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is the most widely used technique for single-step purification of recombinant proteins. However, despite its use in the purification of heterologue proteins in the eubacteria Escherichia coli for decades, the presence of native E. coli proteins that exhibit a high affinity for divalent cations such as nickel, cobalt or copper has remained problematic. This is of particular relevance when recombinant molecules are not expressed at high levels or when their overexpression induces that of native bacterial proteins due to pleiotropism and/or in response to stress conditions. Identification of such contaminating proteins is clearly relevant to those involved in the purification of histidine-tagged proteins either at small/medium scale or in high-throughput processes. The work presented here reviews the native proteins from E. coli most commonly co-purified by IMAC, including Fur, Crp, ArgE, SlyD, GlmS, GlgA, ODO1, ODO2, YadF and YfbG. The binding of these proteins to metal-chelating resins can mostly be explained by their native metal-binding functions or their possession of surface clusters of histidine residues. However, some proteins fall outside these categories, implying that a further class of interactions may account for their ability to co-purify with histidine-tagged proteins. We propose a classification of these E. coli native proteins based on their physicochemical, structural and functional properties. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli DH10B was designed for the propagation of large insert DNA library clones. It is used extensively, taking advantage of properties such as high DNA transformation efficiency and maintenance of large plasmids. The strain was constructed by serial genetic recombination steps, but the underlying sequence changes remained unverified. We report the complete genomic sequence of DH10B by using reads accumulated from the bovine sequencing project at Baylor College of Medicine and assembled with DNAStar's SeqMan genome assembler. The DH10B genome is largely colinear with that of the wild-type K-12 strain MG1655, although it is substantially more complex than previously appreciated, allowing DH10B biology to be further explored. The 226 mutated genes in DH10B relative to MG1655 are mostly attributable to the extensive genetic manipulations the strain has undergone. However, we demonstrate that DH10B has a 13.5-fold higher mutation rate than MG1655, resulting from a dramatic increase in insertion sequence (IS) transposition, especially IS150. IS elements appear to have remodeled genome architecture, providing homologous recombination sites for a 113,260-bp tandem duplication and an inversion. DH10B requires leucine for growth on minimal medium due to the deletion of leuLABCD and harbors both the relA1 and spoT1 alleles causing both sensitivity to nutritional downshifts and slightly lower growth rates relative to the wild type. Finally, while the sequence confirms most of the reported alleles, the sequence of deoR is wild type, necessitating reexamination of the assumed basis for the high transformability of DH10B.},

Here, we present an atomic-resolution structure of a native contracted Vibrio cholerae sheath determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The sheath subunits, composed of tightly interacting proteins VipA and VipB, assemble into a six-start helix. The helix is stabilized by a core domain assembled from four $\beta$ strands donated by one VipA and two VipB molecules. The fold of inner and middle layers is conserved between T6SS and phage sheaths. However, the structure of the outer layer is distinct and suggests a mechanism of interaction of the bacterial sheath with an accessory ATPase, ClpV, that facilitates multiple rounds of effector delivery. Our results provide a mechanistic insight into assembly of contractile nanomachines that bacteria and phages use to translocate macromolecules across membranes.},

In contrast to other bacteria in the genus that only infect insects, P. asymbiotica strains are able to infect both insects and humans. Using a combination of Solexa (Illumina) and 454 Life Sciences (Roche) sequence data in different assembly pipelines, we report on a draft genome sequence of a strain of P. asymbiotica recovered from a patient from Kingscliff, Australia. The best assembly yielded an N50 scaffold size of 288 627 base pairs (bp) with {\textgreater}88.6{\%} of the predicted genome covered by scaffolds over 100 000 bp. One of the central differences found between this Australian isolate and the US isolate is the presence of an additional plasmid, pPAA3. This plasmid is similar to pCRY from Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, and the presence of pPAA3 may account for the increased virulence of Australian isolates both against tissue culture cells and infected patients. The genome of the Kingscliff strain also contains several genomic differences from the US isolate, whose potential significance in virulence against both humans and insects is discussed.},

We report the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of gpV, the protein comprising the major portion of the noncontractile phage lambda tail tube. This structure is very similar to a previously solved tail tube protein from a contractile-tailed phage, providing the first direct evidence of an evolutionary connection between these 2 distinct types of phage tails. A remarkable structural similarity is also seen to Hcp1, a component of the bacterial type VI secretion system. The hexameric structure of Hcp1 and its ability to form long tubes are strikingly reminiscent of gpV when it is polymerized into a tail tube. These data coupled with other similarities between phage and type VI secretion proteins support an evolutionary relationship between these systems. Using Hcp1 as a model, we propose a polymerization mechanism for gpV involving several disorder-to-order transitions.},

The structures reveal that, in addition to a translocation channel, TcA forms four receptor-binding sites and a neuraminidase-like region, which are important for its host specificity. pH-induced opening of the shell releases an entropic spring that drives the injection of the TcA channel into the membrane. Binding of TcB/TcC to TcA opens a gate formed by a six-bladed $\beta$-propeller and results in a continuous protein translocation channel, whose architecture and properties suggest a novel mode of protein unfolding and translocation. Our results allow us to understand key steps of infections involving Tc toxins at the molecular level.},

While the largely alpha-helical conformation is relatively independent of the method of incorporation into vesicles, i.e., rehydration, detergent dialysis, or detergent dilution, the proteolipid conformation was significantly different in detergent micelles and in organic solvents. Only very slight changes in the CD spectrum were observed upon binding of the H+-ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to the proteolipid in vesicles, thus suggesting that the inhibitor acts either by blocking the channel or by masking an essential charge group, rather by than causing an overall conformational change in the channel. Additionally, very similar CD spectra were obtained for vesicles with different lipid/protein mole ratios, indicating either that no substantial conformational differences exist between monomer and multimers or that monomers self-associate to form stable complexes during incorporation into vesicles. This study has provided a physical basis for model-building studies of the proteolipid channel structure.},
