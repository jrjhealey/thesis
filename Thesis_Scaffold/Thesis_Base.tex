\lettrine[lraise=0.0, nindent=0.1em, slope=1em]{T}{ his} thesis is submitted to the University of Warwick in support of my application for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. It is an entirely novel work of the authors own creation, and has not been submitted in any previous application for any degree. The author previously submitted a Masters thesis, entitled ``\emph{Photorhabdus asymbiotica} as a Model Organism for Understanding Emerging Human Pathogens", for the degree of M.Sc. Mathematical Biology and Biophysical Chemistry, for a related project in 2014. While both pieces of work are the authors own, due to sharing commonality in research topic, there may be some superficial resemblance in introductory content and methods.

All work was conducted by the author except in the cases outlined below.

Assistance with protein purification (including running FPLC-IMAC and Gel Filtration processes), as well as Crystallography screening and diffraction testing, was kindly performed with Dr. Avinash Punekar and Dr. Chris Thoroughgood. Thanks go to Dr. Alexia Hapeshi for all the NGS data generated in sequencing constructs and for new genomes. A Masters student, Katie Smart, created the promoter constructs utilised in \vref{regulation}.

\lettrine[lraise=0.0, nindent=0.1em, slope=1em]{T}{ he} ``\emph{Photorhabdus} Virulence Cassette" is an elaborate macromolecular protein complex evolved to specifically and potently deliver effector molecules to the interior of target cells. A PVC can be thought of a ``headless bacteriophage", with with a protein cargo rather than a nucleic acid one. This thesis sheds light on some of the `dark matter' in the content and operon structure of PVCs, though mysteries remain. The Introduction guides the reader through the universe of similar protein complexes. The first 2 results chapters `pave the way' for lab experiments by examining the PVCs in a number of computational workflows. In Chapter 3, the disconnect between sequence and structure for proteins is examined - and what this means for PVCs. Through sensitive methods, less dependent on sequence, new, informative homologies are detected, and we get a `first look' at the likely structure for many elements of a PVC. Chapter 4 explores the operon structure of PVCs, identifying proteins which may be non-essential to PVC function, and demonstrating the `microevolution' in, and variability between, operons. In the first of the `wet lab' chapters, Chapter 5 examines the enigmatic proposed `tail fibres' of the PVCs, identified as hypervariable in Chapter 4. This chapter represents the first experimental study of of a potentially unique chimeric fibre protein, and provides the first experimental data confirming their true nature as real tail fibres. Finally, Chapter 6 details the efforts made to heterologously clone controllable PVCs - a non-trivial task it turns out; and to understand the regulation and population dynamics of how PVCs are deployed by \emph{Photorhabdus} naturally, with preliminary observations implicating a role for RfaH-like proteins and anti-termination/operon polarity suppression.

\chapter*{Note to the reader}


Welcome to the future! This thesis contains elements which can be viewed in augmented reality! (I know right?!). If you want to view these features, you'll need a smart phone or tablet device, and you'll need to download the ``Augment" app. It can be found in the the Google Play Store or Apple App Store (\url{www.augment.com}) - don't worry, it's free!

Any time you see the symbol below on a page (bottom left footer), you can scan that page with the app, and see the model spring to life on the page! (Note, that due to some rendering limitations of mobile devices `horsepower' and reduced resolution, the augmented reality image may not entirely resemble the image on the page, and in cases where the render would have been too large, the image might have been replaced with a related one for simplicity).

\chapter{Publications arising from this candidature}\label{publications}
The following is a paper published in Angewandte Chemie in 2017. The structural modelling within the paper was performed by me and is the basis of my inclusion as an author. This paper is included as an appendix as it was a publication arising from a side project during my PhD candidature, but is not relevant to my personal thesis research, though the same methods as described in Chapter \ref{structbioinfo} were used.

As a brief abstract for the reader; the paper concerns attempts to create mimics of biological `antifreeze' proteins, for application in areas such as cryopreservation. Ice crystal growth is a significant problem which leads to reduction in cell viability, and compromises the quality of vital resources such as stored donor blood, among others. Current methods employ toxic compounds such as glycerol and dimethylsulfoxide which can cause undesirable downstream consequences for the patient, and also require extensive dialysis which high in cost, both in terms of time and money, and is low in efficiency.

The paper demonstrates that polyproline helices exhibit ice recrystallisation inhibition activity, and it is postulated that this is due to alternating patches of hydrophobicity and -philicity (amphipathy). When used in concert with one of the standard cryopresevation additives, 10\% DMSO, polyproline additives increased cellular recovery from thawing by up to 30\%.
